Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Deutsche Post DHL conference call regarding the H1 results 2014.  (Operator Instructions).
Let me now hand the floor over to Martin Ziegenbalg.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, thank you and a warm welcome to everyone out there, good morning in the US and good afternoon in Europe to our Q2 conference call.  As you have seen from our mailing this morning, we will have on the call our CEO, Frank Appel, who is not here in the Bonn office but who has dialed in and, of course, also with our CFO, Larry Rosen who will both take you through the presentation, I take it you have in front of you.  And as usual afterwards we've got time for Q&A.
And without further ado I'd like Frank to start please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, good afternoon and welcome to our Q2 conference call.  Let me just start straightaway with the Q2 highlights on page 2.
We have seen a pretty good second quarter despite continuing headwinds from currencies.  We have seen, if you exclude the last year release of the provision, a flat result in the PeP division on the EBIT number despite that we had one less working day. We had a very good development, again in express with a margin higher than 10%, 10.7% actually.  And we also had a good cash flow generation in the second quarter if you take the dividend payment into consideration.
So overall we are sure that we will meet our guidance for the Group this year in 2014.  I will come later onto some changes underneath but the Group will deliver as we have promised for this year.
In the last weeks we have evaluated the progress with regard to NFE and the forwarding division and having now John Gilbert on board we've also looked into opportunities to improve the performance of the supply chain division further.  And we are pretty sure that we are pretty sure that we are on the right path with NFE, I will explain in a second that it might take a little bit longer and take more money than we assumed at the beginning.  And also in supply chain we see some opportunities to improve the performance further.
And that's the reason why we want to modify the guidance for 2015, but also at the same time, because we are very confident about the outcome of those things, we introduced for the first time a guidance for 2016 I will share later on with you.
If then turn to page 3 that's a very good summary of where we stand with NFE at the moment.  I'm reviewing that together with Roger's team on a retro basis and Larry is participating as well because it's an important journey for us.  We are pretty happy with the system rollout, the platform delivers not only the functionality but also better transparency and we are very confident that we can deliver the productivity gains we have assumed at the beginning.
So that is all good, but the chances of data migrations are even significantly higher than we assumed in our challenging assumption, that means we need more intensive work with the organization in the field really get all the quality to the level we need to run the new system successfully.
At the same time, as we explained several times, we are changing the organization, we are now going through a functional organization and that, of course, is a quite challenging situation for an organization against the background of a quite challenging business environment for the forwarding division.  And we are now successfully live with the new organization in 30 countries, we will add very soon 50 additional ones and therefore we are pretty happy with the progress here as well.
Nevertheless, the system rollout in combination with organizational changes and the challenges in the business environment is quite challenging overall.  We believe that NFE is the right solution and it will deliver the benefits we hoped but, as I said, it might take longer than we hoped.
So on page 4 you can see the next steps, we are now preparing after we are live in five countries, larger countries now for the rollout that will take place later this year.  We will then have countries live around the world which, of course, is important as well.
We also will take some additional management -- measures to train people every more than we assumed so far so that we really get the full benefit of the NFE capabilities early on.
That leads to the implication that we will have a rollout including 2015, so that means it's longer, roughly 12, 15 months longer than we originally anticipated.  We will implement first ocean freight and then air freight.  And we will incur additional costs for NFE this year and next.  So that's the situation.
If I summarize that and having reviewed with Roger, I'm pretty sure that we are doing here, or I'm very sure that we are doing here the right thing, but the SAP rollout is more challenging and the data quality we found is worse than we hoped so, and that's the situation which will have impact on next year's numbers.
The second is more an opportunity, supply chain has delivered very solidly to the Group results of the last years and it is continuing this year, you will see that later on, the quarter was a good one.  But John Gilbert has identified significant opportunities to strengthen our margins but also our business further and we are assessing at the moment what can we do and what it costs to really help him to deliver what he has in this mind.  They are things like more standardization of our process, delayering the organization, addressing some underperforming businesses and some other element.  We will explain more in detail and also the amounts necessary not today but later on.  But also this will mainly impact the 2015 numbers and will show benefits already in 2016.
So if we take these together, that has indications on our guidance, not for this year, but we believe that doing the right thing for the long term is the right thing to do here.  We see opportunities in supply chain and we are very confident that NFE is a significant help to improve our margins in the forwarding business as well and that's the reason why we have decided that we will want to take additional measures in particular in 2015 which should deliver then in 2016 results.
So in addition, it should also strengthen our base to deliver our communicated targets for 2020.
And if I take that into now numbers of page 7, we reconfirm our Group guidance for this year but we are changing the guidance for the PeP and the DHL division.  We are confident that PeP will deliver EUR100m more than the previous guidance but the DHL divisions will deliver EUR100m and the main driver behind that is that we are not as fast as we'd hoped for the NFE rollout and we will incur additional costs.  But overall looking also into the corporate center/other, we are very confident that we will make the EUR2.9b to EUR3.1b guidance of this year.
As I already said, we will have impact in 2015 since we have not finalized all the measures and the costs we might we take.  We will give you from now on more guidance for 2015 that we are confident that PeP will be better than this year and also DHL division will be better than this year.  The corporate center we kept the guidance so far, EUR350m minus, but overall we believe that 2015 will be significantly better than 2014.
All that should lead then to another step and that's the first time we are introducing that, the first time our guidance for 2016, that again in 2016 the PeP division should deliver more than EUR1.3b, the DHL division should, as shown here, EUR2.45b to EUR2.75b and the corporate center should remain on the level of 2015 and that should lead to a Group number of EUR3.4b to EUR3.7b.
So we are very confident about all these numbers which are shown on this page, particularly in our consideration the extra costs we will incur in 2015.
For 2014 we also want to reassure you that the free cash flow will, at least, cover the dividend for 2013, the tax rate will be around 16%, so an improvement to the previous guidance, and we also confirm that the CapEx will be around EUR1.9b.  So all these numbers I think, except the tax rate, have been communicated already before.
Coming to the last page I want to present, based on 2013 numbers now we want to reassure that all that we are doing now and the changed guidance for 2015 and the newly introduced guidance for 2016, should enable us to deliver what we have promised at the capital markets day three months ago. We are very sure that what we will do in particular in DGF and supply chain will help us to make that happen.
Free cash flow generation will remain a top priority, we have no ambition to do any major M&A, we don't see any need, and finally, our finance policy, as outlined already for now a couple of years will remain unchanged.
So overall, despite some challenges in the economy and foreign exchange, we reconfirm our guidance for 2014 after our strong second quarter.  We believe that we have opportunities to improve the performance of our business even further and that's the reason why we want to take some extra costs next year.  We are very sure that we can make then the 2016 numbers and that should be a good step to the direction to 2020.
And I think that's a good package to go for and I think we have been prudent in looking into the opportunities to improve our model further and I hope that you see that in the same way despite that we have changed slightly the guidance for 2015.
And with no further ado I would like to hand over now to Larry to explain a little bit more the details of Q2.  Thank you for listening.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Frank, and let's come back to a closer look at Q2 on page 9.  In Q2 our top-line performance was good with organic growth of 4.2% and contributions from each of the four divisions.
EBIT was up on a reported basis by 6% but excluding the positive net one-offs from last year, growth was around 11%.  PeP EBIT was flat year over year excluding the EUR50m utilization of the stamp provision as growth, especially in the German parcel business, is being offset by higher factor costs.  DHL performance is quite good, led by significant growth in volumes and EBIT in our express division.  So I'll come back to each of the divisions in just a couple of minutes.
Our financial result comparison is influenced by a positive one-off from last year and we continue to have good news on the tax rate which we again revised downward from 19% to 16% due to improved expectations on our ability to utilize tax loss carry-forwards in the future.
This all led to a solid 9% bottom line income growth for the quarter.
Moving on to page 10.  Cash flow performance was good almost reaching the level of last year when cash flow performance was excellent.  The Q2 performance also demonstrates that the phasing effects from Q4 have been largely absorbed in Q1 and our no longer playing a major role.
CapEx continues at a low level, we expect an increase in the second half of the year consistent with your guidance for the full year.
On page 11 you see that our net debt increased to EUR2.9b at mid-year, a significant increase since the end of last year but certainly not unexpected since we paid the annual civil servant contribution, pension contribution, in Q1 and the annual dividend in Q2 and those two items made up around EUR1b of cash out in the first half.  And we do expect the usual seasonal pattern to emerge in the second half in that net debt will again significantly decrease by the end of the year.
Then onto page 12, is a summary of revenue and EBIT performance by division.  And, again, PeP EBIT was virtually unchanged excluding the one-time positive effect from the stamp provision.  That provision utilization also affected the revenue so on a like-for-like basis we actually had EUR50m of revenue growth and a flat EBIT performance.
Express had another excellent quarter with a record EBIT margin at 10.7%.
Global forwarding and freight continues to suffer from weak market conditions which have led to lower gross profit levels and lower EBIT.  But certainly a positive aspect in Q2 was the recovery in volume growth in both ocean and air freight.
Supply chain continues to general very good organic revenue growth, almost 6% in Q2 and EBIT also grew strongly, even considering that in Q2 of last year there was a charge of around EUR20m related to the divestiture of a subsidiary and also some restructuring.
On page 13 taking a closer look at PeP volume development, volume growth in letters was actually quite good, benefiting in Q2 and actually the first half from additional volumes from the EU and regional elections in Germany, as well as the further volume from the SEPA in the Eurozone.
And e-commerce growth continues to drive solid growth in our German parcel business with around 6% growth in volume and revenues.  The transfer of foreign parcel businesses from DHL to PeP has gone very well with a smooth transition and increasingly a new orientation toward e-commerce.
Page 14, a quick update on E-Post, or E-Postbrief as we originally called.  We're very pleased to report the good progress.  E-Post is our secure digital product.  We not have a broad range of business customers and expect revenues this year to exceed EUR200m for the full year and the originally planned target to breakeven by 2015 will also be achieved.
Part of this success has been due to additional innovations that we've developed to enhance the product even further making it attractive for a broad range of business and private customers and you see some of those innovations at the bottom of the chart that you're looking at.
On page 15, so a brief summary of the P&L which we've actually already discussed.  Here again we have good volume growth in letters and especially parcels but it's being offset by factor cost increases, in particular labor costs.
Cash flow is in line with EBIT performance but significantly reduced from last year's Q2 when we had an unusually positive working capital development due to phasing.
CapEx remains low but should increase strongly in the second half as we invest more, especially in our parcel infrastructure.
And now turning to express, the performance here really continues to be exemplary with very good volume growth in all regions, likely reflecting further market share gains in Q2.  The EBIT margin increased 1.3% over last year's Q2 to 10.7% reflecting the scale benefits of our volume growth and continued excellent cost management.
And on page 17 you can see more directly the leverage effect for express with organic revenue growth of 7.2% and EBIT growth more than twice as high with 17.7%.
In the quarter we had a further release of our restructuring provision in the US and our exit from -- that's related to our exit from the domestic business back in 2008.  This release is similar in size and nature to the one we had in 2012, many of you may remember that.  This gave us opportunity to accelerate our plans for renewal of the aircraft fleet and take an impairment charge for the remaining depreciation of older aircraft which we will replace in the near future.  These two items offset each other at around EUR100m each in the quarter.
Cash flow performance was quite good, increasing in line with the EBIT increase.
Page 18, we just completed a market survey, it's an independent market survey that we've funded.  We first did it back in 2012 and we wanted to share the results with you and it shows the market shares in the TDI segment, our core express business and you can see that in each of the regions we have gained share, we're the worldwide leader in TDI.  We've picked up share in each region except for the Americas where our share was unchanged and we believe that our strong leadership in emerging markets, where the highest growth is taking place, should continue to drive good growth and potentially further market share gains for the foreseeable future.
Page 19, as you can see we had some volume growth in air freight for the first time in several quarters reflecting some recovery in the industry but also our success in winning new business and focusing on sectors with more growth.  Ocean freight also had a healthy growth for the quarter.
Margins, however remain at historically low levels as air and ocean lines have done a good job managing capacities and large customers have been able to negotiate good prices in the soft economic environment.
NFE costs were as planned in the quarter and about the same as last year's Q2, but should increase in the second half as Frank discussed.
On page 20 you can see that EBIT continued to underperform last year but Q2 was sequentially far better than Q1 as volumes picked up and growth margins at least stabilized although at a low level.
CapEx increased due to higher NFE investments, so in OpEx NFE investment was about flat with last year's Q2 but in CapEx we had higher NFE investments.
On page 21 you can see the trend of new business wins in supply chain return to historical levels and gave us just over EUR500m of new signings for the first half, well on track for our target of more than EUR1b for the full year.  In the business overall we're seeing strong growth in the automatic and life science segments.
And on page 22, organic revenue growth for supply chain was strong with almost 6% for the quarter driven by strong business wins in previous quarters and good growth especially in emerging markets.
EBIT grew strongly and EBIT margin increased slightly.  The year-over-year comparison is distorted by a one-time effect in Q2 of last year related to the disposal of a subsidiary and some smaller restructuring expense, in total of around EUR20m but we will even with that had around 10% growth in EBIT on a like-for-like basis.
So in summary on page 23, Deutsche Post DHL is in very good shape currently and I think for the long term.  All of our divisions are leaders in their industries and are well positioned for the future.  The additional investments in DGF and supply chain affects short-term performance mainly 2015, but are absolutely the right things to do strategically and will allow us to make a step change in the performance of both of those divisions.  Other aspects of strategy 2020 are well into execution and very much on track.
So thanks for listening and Frank and I will be happy to answer your questions.

Okay, operator please.

(Operator Instructions). Robin Byde, Cantor Fitzgerald.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello Robin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robin Byde,  Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just two from me please, both in express.  In Americas I think currency adjusted your revenues were up about 10% year on year so can you talk a bit more about what the big growing flows are here.  Is this US domestic for example or north/south traffic?
And then secondly, I just saw that DHL announced some investments in the UK network, I think it was GBP160m worth of upgrades at Heathrow and East Midlands, so could you just talk a bit about the growth opportunity there please.  Thanks

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
May I speak generally about the US and, Larry, if you have more detail, I think we won't disclose here the trade flows, but overall I think we have seen now for a couple of years what we originally hoped that might happen, that the service quality of an international product needs all the legs being it to Southern Cone or to Europe and Asia and I think we have demonstrated that the service quality is now on a level which enables us to gain even market share in the home market of our largest competitors in the US.
With regard to the expansion of the network, I think these are the normal activities we have to do and we have announced Leipzig recently as well, we have just opened another facility or expansion in Egypt so we continue really to invest into the growth and we see for a while already significantly higher growth than we anticipated a couple of -- when we did the last (inaudible).  So East Midlands and Heathrow is more or less a consequence of our success on the way to the US because that is a stopover in East Midlands and Heathrow is our success in the UK because that's a gateway for the UK for the (technical difficulty) network.  So these are investments which just, we have to do because we experience a significant growth in all parts of the world including the UK.
I don't know, Larry, if you want to add something on the detail but I think we usually don't talk too much about the detail of trade lanes and I explained a little bit already why we are gaining market share in the US.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, maybe I'll just add that all of the volume growth and all the business we have in the US is cross-border so none of it is domestic.   And also I think, this is more or less what Frank also said but your business in the US or in any country in a global network business depends on your position in that country but your position all over the world and, as we've seen, the emerging markets with really good growth consistently, we've seen that our leadership position there has benefited us very much in the mature markets like the US.
Okay, Robin?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neil Glynn,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, good afternoon, everybody.  If I could ask three questions please, the first on the NFE additional costs.  Just wanted to clarify is there an element of digging deeper here due to a very tough market for all forwarders or what explains the timing of realizing that the business is in worse shape than previously thought at this juncture.
The second question on supply chain, you're obviously taking steps, very rightly I think, to improve its performance over the medium term. But do you think that's a division that can get to covering its costs of capital ultimately?
And then a third question on express, obviously another very impressive margin performance, back at the express update last year you talked about thinking about operating cost per move down in 2013.  I'd just like to get a feel for how much cost control is helping the margin in 2014 if you could clarify whether unit costs are down again in 2014.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, let me take the first two questions and, Larry, you might answer the third.  So with regard to NFE I think the challenge with regard to all the moves we do at the moment is bigger and that leads to more cautious steps in a row.  I think it has to be clear that we have really the countries which are live under good control before we move on.  And we have learned significantly from the first step where we went live in New Zealand and then the second step we went live in Egypt, Canada and Australia.
The learnings are that the data quality we get from the previous systems is not good enough that needs extra work and that, we have to manage as well the overall end-to-end process.  What NF -- the [logis] system we had before it was more a typewriter where you could put all the information in, now we really have to follow the -- the employees have to follow a process and that's new for them.  And they have to learn that and that needs more explanation, and they of course don't see immediately all the benefits, they learn that more over time and that leads to a situation that the progress is slower and we need probably more additional training courses.
On supply chain we believe we can improve the performance significantly with the anticipated measures.  But not to forget that the supply chain division has now earned that cost of capital for several years in a row, including the cost for the goodwill. So we are already for the full year 2011, 2012, 2013 we already have a positive [EIC] which is above -- well positive return which is above our cost of capital. So the division has already earned despite all the goodwill which is in this business has earned its cost of capital.
And maybe with that, Neil, I would hand over to Larry with regard to the express cost control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so OCPM is a metric that jumps around a bit from quarter to quarter. Thus far in the year we've had one quarter where it's slightly down one quarter slightly up so it's about flat for the year. It depends sometimes on weather conditions and it's a little bit variable.   Where we've gotten really good leverage is in aviation cost per move or per kilo or per shipment, that's where we've seen some really good leverage and where we've made the most progress this year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neil Glynn,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great, just to follow on, on that very quickly, Larry, when you mention that it jumps around, and I guess if it is broadly flat year to date, does that prompt you to go on and to try to do more or to prompt Ken to go on and try to do more or is that acceptable?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely, we think that there is more progress that we can make on OCPM, operating cost per move. Some of it is investment depending and many of the investments we are doing.  And, yes, we do think that there is more potential there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, and may I add one additional comment, so I think we now see really the full impact in express of these CISP, certified international specialist programs.  Ken has talked about in several occasions and Larry and I have talked about, the engagement and the motivation in the organization is phenomenal and that leads to the significant continuous improvement we see in the operations and drives the margins.
That is also the reason, because we have seen the impact already quite early, that we roll that out in the other divisions. And that is for instance supply chain, one of the reasons that we have additional cost planned for next year when we want to do similar things like the WPCS program.
I think in a service industry with a lot of employees it's key that the people really understand the purpose of what we are doing, the discipline to execute the operations and get appropriate training. And we will invest into that in the other divisions as outlined in our strategy 2020. And we are very confident and I am personally very confident that this will help us to improve our margins in all the divisions even further.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neil Glynn,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's great, thank you.

David Ross, Stifel Nicolaus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, good afternoon gentlemen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Dave.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the international front, shipment growth was terrific but it looks like the revenues didn't exceed the shipments by too much.  I know there is some currency impact going on and could you comment on any other impact to potential yields and maybe a weight per shipment change. And what's your view as the underlying yield environment on the international express market right now?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I was going to ask, David, you are referring to express, indeed that's right the revenues are influenced by currencies.  Generally we are seeing a slight benefit from average pricing or average yield, but there is also some weight affect, weight per shipment effect as the parcel business is growing faster than the flat business or the letter-like express business, so there is a whole bunch of effects including currencies that all comes together to give us a slightly higher revenue-per-day trend than shipment-per-day trend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So when you are going after the marketplace and pricing the business, is the yield environment with your customers in terms of getting rate increases versus a year ago better today than it was last year or about the same?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think it's about the same if you would qualify it that way yes.  You could describe it that way that it's about the same as last year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No material change in either direction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes and then last question is on the supply chain division.  You had a lot of good business wins in the quarter in different markets and different industry sectors. But could you talk about the type of business wins you were getting whether they'd be more value-added warehousing-type operations, transportation management or other logistic services you are performing for customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I think we did -- in the quarter we did well in the automotive and life science sectors.  I think the mix between warehousing, value-added warehousing where we are doing some other activity than simple warehousing, are pretty much the same as our existing mix.  So there wasn't a big portion of additional value-added business but it wasn't lower than what our average mix is either.
Does that answer the question?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Dave.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andy Chu, Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andy Chu,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks very much. Good afternoon everyone.  A few questions from me, just starting off with the incremental cost and, Frank, Larry when if ever, when are you going to quantify the cost of NFE and supply chain restructuring?  And just to be absolutely clear about it, I guess they are one-off in nature, but you won't strip them out I guess in terms of calling them out as exceptional charges.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, yes, we don't plan to do that and start to implement then underlying earnings and reported earnings, so we are not going to go back to that.  I think for NFE we have hesitated, do hesitate and will hesitate to quantify the amount of those investments because we think it's competitively sensitive and so we are very hesitate to put very concrete numbers around that.
For supply chain I think we may share more with you about the amounts of those costs, but probably won't do that until next year in the context of announcing our full-year 2015 concrete guidance and that for DHL and then talking about the role that restructuring of supply chain might play in that.

Andy Chu,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thank you.  And then there's two others please.  Just in terms of your PeP upgrade by EUR100m I guess when we look at the first half it doesn't seem to be anything in there that would indicate why we should feel a little bit -- or why you are feeling a little bit more comfortable around -- and confident around that target.  We know that obviously that mechanical things like wage inflation probably have not been as difficult in the second half as the first half, you've got slightly less than one more working day.  But where does that confidence come from please in terms of a higher number in terms of 2014 PeP EBIT? Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, Andy, I think you hit actually two out of the three reasons.  In fact, the pattern of wage increases in the current tariff agreement are such that we see the biggest impact in the first half, then a lower impact in Q3 and then again an impact in Q4 but not as high as in the first half. So the wage increase impact overall is less than what it was in the first half.
And we also have instead of one less working day, as we did in the first half, we have almost one more working day so that certainly helps. And also remember it's the peak quarter in Q4, in particular the parcel business, where volumes are significantly higher than any other quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andy Chu,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.  And just a final question on DGS, I guess Larry if I heard you correctly that your saying that the now incremental NFE cost in Q2 year on year, so I guess the reported EBIT being down 21% I guess there is FX effect in there.  But that does seem to be quite a dramatic fall off in profitability versus your peers, and I was trying to get a sense of the actual market movement within that 21%.  And what do you think the actual transition program has and how much that may have dented your profitability please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, may -- Andy, I take that.  This is what I have said several times already, such a transformation leads to a more inside-looking atmosphere of an organization and looking to our own history, we have learned in the last years to orient our organization significantly more in customer direction into the market and that has led to significant improvements.
In NFE you have no -- or in DGS you have no choice.  If you really change the structure in the system people are distracted. And we see that in our performance without a doubt.  I am very happy that we now see growth in air freight and ocean freight, but there is definitely impact for our people because they think about what I will have as a future job and what will happen to my boss and so on and so forth.  And that has impact and I think you are right that is a transformation impact you can't avoid to a certain extent which we have assumed as well and that hits now our numbers.
But the underlying business is still a very good business and healthy business.  And with the new system and the possibilities of the new systems I think we can easily recover from these challenges which are really distraction of our people from what they should do actually in the first place is serving the customers in the best way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andy Chu,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And, Frank, because it is so complex and so global I'm never sure how many countries that global forwarding actually hits, but it must be a big part of the world.  Is there risk here that the NFE program takes, actually spills into 2016 or dare I say it even longer, because it is so complex and so global or do you think that you will be finished by the end of 2015?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So you, as you say, finished by the end of next year, we never said we would be finished by the end of 2014, so the majority of the work should be done by 2015.  And we might see some remaining impacts in the first part of 2016, but we also should see significant benefits in 2016.  So I think this year and the next year are the most challenging years for DGF and we will see significantly more countries already back to customer-oriented instead of internally focused.  I'm very sure that the majority of countries will in that situation early 2016.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johannes Braun,  Commerzbank - Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, thank you. Two questions from me, firstly on the tax rate.  Obviously you've lowered your guidance for this year again to 16% now, just wondering if you can say anything on the years to come if there are further tax losses to be activated and the tax rate potential being lower also in the coming years.  And then also attached to that do you expect the taxes paid are also accordingly lower so will that have a positive impact on free cash flow.
And secondly on this impairment on the express fleet, obviously that should reduce regular depreciation also going forward, just wondered if this has a significant impact on depreciation going forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry, I think that's all you, yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I take those.  So, on the tax rate, so, yes, we are quite confident about the 16% for this year.  We would not like to announce any forecast at this time for future years.  We'll do that for sure for 2015 when we announce the rest of the 2015 guidance most likely in March.
Cash taxes are less affected, although clearly over time there will be an equalization so that cash taxes should tend to be lower as we are able to utilize more tax loss carry-forwards. So in terms of the impairment yes, we do reduce depreciation but it is by only a very small double-digit amount per year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tobias Sittig,  MainFirst Bank - Analyst    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions, three if I may the first two I think for Frank and the third one for Lawrence.  On forwarding and the longer term ,basically you want to get towards best in class and that's pretty much deemed to be something around 30% EBIT to gross profit.  Will you be there by 2016, 2017?  And if not what is missing?  What's the missing part to get towards best in class margins then?
Secondly, on mail there has been a bit of a hassle with your employee representatives in the supervisory board and generally you've got low inflation and low leeway to raise prices on the one hand, on the other head there is a broad sense in Germany that now may be the time to get higher wages.  What confidence can you give us that your main margin doesn't get squeezed in that big picture environment?
And the third point on the pension provisions so why just that EUR1b.  And I just wonder whether than changes your thinking about rating shareholder returns, whether that might be pushed back further in terms of extra dividends or share buybacks or whatever you may have in mind. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes Tobias, maybe on the DGF, so I think it's not today the time to really commit when we really will achieve the best-in-class margins what I can say is that we are very confident from what we see currently from the deployment of the systems that we should, in principal, have two benefits.  We should have more visibility and that should help us on gross profit margin, despite that it is challenging but in principal the gross profit margin should be better if you have trading business more visibility than your competitors and your customers and even your carriers.
And the second is the indirect costs of the direct operating expenses which are the people costs we have, should improve significantly due to the productivity gains we have.  Therefore, we can't see any reasons to why we should not come to best in class margins, but I think today we are telling you that we need more cost to implement that.  I would not like to give you now a target when it will happen.  I think we will give you more detail when we are more sure and have seen more countries going live than this moment will come, but I am very confident that the system which should help us to be really best in class.
On the mail division, you're right, it's not easy to come to easy terms with the unions. But on the other side, we have a demand and this is what we say again and again is if you have a growing business you have to keep your margin at least stable, otherwise it's not sustainable. And we've made that very clear.
We can offer something which is nice for our employees which is certainty for employment, and even an increase in employment because we have hired new people in the last year, which is something which is extremely important to employees.  The motivation actually in the parcel part where you have a pure play parcel delivery is on our employee opinion service the highest.  So that shows that from being the underdog for a long, long period they now feel very confident about their own future.  And creating new jobs and building confidence in the workforce is an enormous asset we have, and we will use that.
And I said recently in a press interview that it can't be that the people who are working for us for 35 years -- or new people shouldn't have the same salaries as people who have worked for our company 35 years.  I think we have to become more competitive with salaries for newcomers, and we will work on that.  It will not be easy, but we had challenges in the past as well.  I think we have a good package to offer to our employees and particularly people who are joining our group and giving -- getting a very secure job for the future should make also their mind up if they want to work for us or some of our competitors where they will definitely earn significantly less.
I think that will be the discussion.  I'm pretty sure that we will come to an agreement which is fair to the existing employees and also fair for new people.  But also that's important both important for both groups that it will help us to create sustainable growth in the business. And that means sustainable and stable margins at least.
And maybe the last question with regards to rating, Larry, you should answer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so indeed our pension liability or unfunded pension liability increased by around EUR1b.  And that's due entirely to the further reduction in the discount rate that we use for calculating the pension liability.  Every time we've reduced the discount rate in the last couple of years I think it can't possibly go lower and then it does. So it did again.  And of course with the introduction last year of the new accounting standard IAS-19R it means that the calculated amount of the liability has to be recognized immediately and equity is reduced by that amount.
But now connecting this new accounting world with our intentions about shareholder distribution, what impresses upon me each time there is a change is how very sensitive the amount of the liability and the amount of underfunding is to the level of the discount rate.  So one day we will go back to a more historically normal interest rate environment, and if you think about a rate environment where the discount rate would be 2% higher than it is today, not really unthinkable in historical context, our unfunded liability would then shrink very dramatically.  So that makes me hesitate to think about a very aggressive further funding of the liability.
Does that answer your question?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tobias Sittig,  MainFirst Bank - Analyst    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And does it -- maybe just following up, does it change the view of the rating agency on potentially upgrading your rating or not?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think it has really any influence. They do take unfunded liabilities into account and pension liabilities into account as if they are long-term debt.  On the other hand, they know that it's really a calculated increase or kind of a mechanical increase in the liability, so I doubt that it really has much impact on rating assessment.

Joel Spungin, Merrill Lynch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joel Spungin,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, good afternoon, gents.  I've just got two questions actually the first is with regards to the Q2 cash generation.  I was just wondering if I could come back, if you look at the conversion of the EBIT into operating cash flow obviously you've had a good step-up in EBIT in the quarter compared to Q2 last year but the operating cash flow is about the same.  So I was just wondering if you could help us reconcile why the conversion was lower in this quarter.  That's my first question.
Then my second question was just with regards to the parcels business within PeP.  Obviously good ongoing volume growth but revenue growth is slower.  So again I was just wondering if there is something going on within price and mix there which you could elaborate on.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, may I take the second.  Larry. you will answer the first.  So in parcel you should not forget that there is still a continuous change from -- into the e-commerce world and that leads of course to that some of the big players are generating significant volumes.  And in the mix that leads to a slight deterioration of the yield.
But overall I think we have been quite successful this year with price increases across the board, but it's a consequence when the big retailers are growing faster than the average they have better rates of course because they have larger volume and that leads to a smaller revenue growth in the parcel growth. But overall we are quite happy with the price increases we could achieve this year over all our customer base.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, so let me come back to the first question, indeed the conversion was a bit lower and I think it really goes back to two things. In last year's Q2 we had quite a good working capital development in the PeP division phasing.  This year we had some working capital increase in the forwarding division in particular on the receivables side where the fight for market share also extended to some slight average extension of terms.  So I think those two things together is what explains most of the slight decline in conversion performance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joel Spungin,  Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many thanks.  Can I just have a quick follow up on the question with regards to parcel?  I was just wondering if you could just maybe comment on whether or not the competitive environment within the German domestic market has changed at all in the last 12 months.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have to say that it has not changed, neither getting worse or getting better.  I think we have very intense competitive.  As you potentially know the parcel prices are the lowest in Germany already for a while and we are used to that.
As I said we are pretty happy with the price increases we have seen, whereas it remains a very competitive market because it's by far the biggest and therefore all our competitors are keen to be placed as well in Germany.  But it didn't get worse either, so I think we are on a relatively stable situation there.  I would love to have higher prices but you know that is not allowed at the moment by the competitive landscape.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jochen Rothenbacher,  Equinet Bank - Analyst    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.  Good afternoon.  I have two questions on the PeP division.  Firstly, the contract with Postbank regarding the retail outlets is or was due for renewal.  Could you give an update on this and the financial impact for you?
And secondly, regarding to the E-Post could you share with us the number of subscribers you currently have for that product?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe Larry you can answer the first question, despite I could as well.  But anyway you might do that.    The E-Post we don't disclose the number of subscribers.  What we can say is that the impact is much more with the larger customers and the mid-sized customers who are using our business box somehow than on the private side.
So what we have learnt in the last years that the benefits for our major customers are tremendous upstream from the postage.  So they can streamline their operations significantly and generate cost savings if they use the E-Post approach.  And that enables them to really -- and that enables us to gain even business back in some places because the total package for the customer is lower than going for lower postage in some places with our competitors than us.
So -- and that has led to the significant increase in revenue.  We see more and more customers converting.  For the small and mid-sized customers, the business box brings a significant easing of their processes.
So if you are a small customers who sends letters out to his customers on a regular basis, you don't need any longer printers and envelopers and whatsoever.  You just send it out from your machine, your PC into our system.  We print it out, envelope it and deliver that either electronically or physically.  And that is an easing of the process, which is very much appreciated by mid-sized customers.
We just announced a cooperation with (inaudible), who will now be our sales channel as well to sell these to a broader base because they are talking to many small and mid-sized enterprises anyway.  And they will sell our boxes, well, because it's an enabling function to make processes leaner.
So to give you a precise number of subscribers, we haven't done that for a long period because we think that's a competitive number which we should not disclose.
And maybe with that, Larry, you can answer the first question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so with regard to the contract with Postbank, the original expiration has been the end of 2014.   This is a relationship that has very significant benefits for both Postbank and for us to have combined post office and retail financial centers.  In principle we have extended that beyond 2014.  But for competitive confidentiality reasons, I don't want to cite the particular financial terms of that arrangement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jochen Rothenbacher,  Equinet Bank - Analyst    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Could you say whether it is more favorable for you or not?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Again that -- there is confidentiality on our side from a competitive standpoint, but also respecting very much confidentiality on the part of Postbank, I would not want to disclose more about that arrangement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jochen Rothenbacher,  Equinet Bank - Analyst    [64]

Damian Brewer, RBC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, good afternoon.  Thanks.  I've got probably three questions please.  First of all, in terms of the H1 trading, during the prepared remarks you mentioned the supply chain business still had some underperforming operations.  Could you give us a feel for what proportion of the business falls into that category and therefore I assume moves along a sort of up or out profile?  I'll give you all the questions at once.
Secondly, although your discussion focused on the cost of NFE, thinking back to the last decade when DHL Express went through something in terms of the investment in IT, refocusing the business, the people and delivering quality that also delivered a sort of halo effect in terms of revenue growth and market share gains, which I assume explains part of what we're seeing in today's presentation.  Is there any aspiration for both the freight forwarding business or supply chain business to move along a similar track, i.e. better quality gets better quality clients and better margins?
And then the very final question comes down to dividend.  I noticed you'd mentioned you're effectively reiterating your dividend payout range in the Vision 2020.  Given that the profit mix this year has shifted to the less capital intensive parts of the business, you still be aiming at free cash flow generation to outpace EBIT.
Where is that risk in that profit range?  And last year I think you paid out just under 50%, but the range goes up to 40% to 60%.  Could there be a scenario where that top end of that range gets tested?  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry, let me take the two -- first two questions.
So we will definitely have some restructuring in some countries but this is not a big challenge.  Overall there are some gains to be made and I think we should invest into those.  The majority of the business is in good shape otherwise the progress we have seen over the last years had not been possible.  So it's not the majority.  We, of course, don't want to talk about the detail which countries where we have some bad business.
Second is the NFE is really what I have talked about internally and Roger as well.  We industrialize a trading business somehow.  The history of that is that you know and you write down on the back of the envelope what the rates are and all this kind of stuff.  I think there are significant opportunities to improve along all the P&L items of the forwarding business by having more transparency that should lead more to revenue growth because we should be able to offer better rates.  And despite -- and we can offer better rates because we are buying better because we are bundling our resources better, our demand.  And you can go through all items.
And that's the idea behind that.  I -- sometimes in one on ones, I compare that with you know if you book a flight in a system you have to follow a certain process that you have ways to find the cheapest price somehow with the help.  And we should be able to help our customers as well to find the best and the cheapest possibility through the system.
At the moment we have a big machine where you type something into the machine but you don't know what are your colleagues are doing.  So there is potential.  A case, just to give you an example that we have booked capacity from Amsterdam to New York and the Dutch organization is using that but not to fully extent.  And we have a colleague sitting in Paris selling for the same route something for a French customer who is tracking that to Amsterdam, is buying from the same airline something and not knowing that there is still empty capacity available because the system doesn't give us transparency.
With the new system we get that transparency and we can bundle that.   The colleague in Paris knows that the Dutch guys have not sold all their capacity and he can reuse that.  That should give us significant opportunities.  So these are just examples what we are doing here and I call it industrialization of the whole industry.  And I think that should give us significant opportunities, not only in margin but also in growth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So coming to the third question on dividend policy, I think there is no reason to expect any appreciable change on our policy towards the regular dividend.  We'll stay in that 40% to 60% range.  We will decide early each year where we want to be in that range depending on how we're feeling about the current year's performance, how the cash flow has developed.
And the third factor we take into account is continuity that we would be loath to reduce the dividend, if we have a small decline in performance which we don't expect.  But if we ever did have that we would certainly take continuity into account.
So basically our dividend policy hasn't changed and we intend to follow it for the foreseeable future.  But I think it's too early to talk about shading within the range until we get toward the very end of the year and beginning of next year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thank you.  Can I just ask one quick follow up on NFE?  And that's just, it sounds like the way you process orders at the moment, if one could put it that way is relatively clunky and probably lends itself to servicing very large customers.  With NFE in place, whether it's in late 2015 into 2016 or whenever, how much does that change the Company's ability to position for small and medium sized customers?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think you're putting attention to a very important point.  I talked about the challenges we face at the moment with margins due to the internal focus.  But there's an additional one and that is -- I'm saying that before I answer your question.
There's also something we have benefited for a decade by being the most global provider for our large customers.  And we have benefited significantly from the huge volumes from these customers and we made good business.  But our customers became more sophisticated as well have significantly more transparency about what they have agreed with us and what is going on in the countries.
And we see now the pressure.  They have more transparency about what they are doing, but we have not the same transparency increase as they have and that creates a significant struggle.  And that disadvantaged us as well by working with smaller customers.  We can't give them the lean processes we need to serve them in the best way and we can't be as customer oriented as we could be with the new system.
So and therefore I think the hunting ground for the future in DGF will be particularly the mid-sized and the smaller customers.  Because of the new system we can behave as a mom and pop shop -- this is the existence of local forwarders -- but with the scale of a large forwarder.  And I think that's the beauty and of course not factored in completely to our future numbers.
But there should be an opportunity that the touch and feel of us should be like a small local forwarder, but we have the scale and the buying power of a large forwarder.  And that should help us with the small, but also give us significant improvements on profitability for the large customers.  But we lost some of the ability due to the progress our customers made.  And we have not caught up with the progress our customers made and that's the reason why we are doing it now with the NFE transformation.

Douglas Hayes,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes good afternoon.  Just one last question from my side.   Can you just give a little bit of commentary into the -- what you're seeing in the domestic markets that you recently moved into the PeP division.  Has there been any change in the volume or the competitive environment in those markets?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, we are pretty happy with the traction the business got.  I think what you see is -- and we don't comment yet and we don't want to disclose volume developments until the end of the year anyway because we want to have a clean baseline with one year before we really comment.
But what we have seen is very encouraging.  You see what has been some of the impression of the people in the express division and they were part of express division was that they are the fifth wheel on a car and now they are the driving wheel somehow because the parcel business is the future for the whole division.  And that creates a significant different motivation for the people.
And we have seen positive impact of that.  We have won some businesses already because the customers see that as well.  They see now as we are a strategic investor into these markets and not only somebody who operates because we had it and we had some synergies or limited synergies and whatsoever.  They really now see that this is now on the top list of one of our divisions.
And we on the other side have the benefit in express that country managers are not distracted from being focused on the international product.
I think it's a classical case where we see encouraging signals.  If you put people in the right focus, be it the international express product or the parcel product and have the teams around those, then you see the benefit.  And we -- I feel very encouraged about the move and the progress we have seen despite that we have not started to disclose the progress we have made.

Hello everybody.  Just a few questions.  First of all, on NFE if we take a step back looking at the change of expectations, is there any significant change in overall CapEx or capitalized software expense?  And how does that impact longer-term margins and what kind of amortization profile is relevant for those amounts?
And the second question is can you give us a bit of color on central cost development and how that may have changed and impacted the new guidance?  Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me take both of those.  I think that the overall amount of investment in terms of CapEx associated with NFE may change from quarter to quarter.  We saw a significant amount of CapEx and an increase over last year's Q2 level.  But the overall investment in those things that we're capitalizing I would say is not really changing over time with NFE.  Most of the increase in investment that we're going to have for NFE is going to be on the OpEx side as we invest much more in things like training for the companies where we're just rolling out this system and less so on the CapEx side.
Corporate center costs, yes, I think you know we've talked for a long time about the estimate for 2015 of EUR350m and we thought it was achievable, but on the aspirational side when we announced it around three years ago.  Now we are very confident to be able to reach that.
So insofar our forecast and expectations haven't changed, but our confidence level has increased.  And for this year I think there's some phasing going on.  We've had pretty good first two quarters.  But our forecast remains that we're going to come in below EUR400m for the full year following last year's EUR422m.

Christopher Combe,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thanks.  And on the NFE costs for amortization, what should we -- what's a good rule of thumb?  Is it three years, two years, four years?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think it's between five to ten years with most of the investment being five to eight years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Combe,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, great.  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, operator, we've got time for one further call.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar, Nomura.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Nomura - Analyst    [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, Frank and Larry.  How are you?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good, how are you?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Nomura - Analyst    [90]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, not bad.  Wrong way to ask a question but don't worry.  Actually I only have one question.  Were you surprised that you were quite a long way through the rollout having done what 30 countries fully aligned before the issues started to throw themselves out?  Or had you been seeing it for a while and hoped you could deal with it as you went along?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so maybe it's a little bit of a strange answer to tha,t Mark.  Of course we had some fear.  But if you do such a transformation what you can't do is that you adapt on a continuous basis everything you do and tell people ah, you know you can spend more money and that kind of stuff.
So what I always tell -- told Roger and what is in alignment with Larry as well we have to keep very tight timelines otherwise we will not get this thing moving anyway and we have to keep our budget tight.
So if we would communicate to the capital market different numbers when we communicate internally, we might have the benefit that we would not surprise you with additional cost, but we would have the disadvantage that we would spend the money anyway and then they need more money.  So tactically we said we have to be extremely tight, even knowing that the timeline we've put in place is extremely aggressive and tight.
Nevertheless, we also have seen some surprises that the data quality was even worse than our worst dreams have been, to be honest.  So there is what I call a limited discipline in the organization.  We find contracts which are written on the back of a paper and have no signature because that's a part of the environment we are dealing with.  And that has to be changed.
So there are definitely some surprises that some things are even worse than we hoped.  On the other side that it takes longer and it might cost a little bit more money than we assumed is somehow not a surprise for me.  But I always said we can't go out with higher numbers because then the people will spend the money anyway because they'll say oh, we have enough money and enough money and then they will spend even more money than we originally planned.  And that's the reason why I said let's keep everything tight and better explain that later on to the market that it takes longer and might cost more than we originally planned.
So it's not a complete -- having seen major progress and also as a consultant before, that's not a significant surprise.  I'm more excited about that all what I hoped for and Roger hoped for we see in the deployment.  We see that the new structure is working; we see that the processes are working, that we get the productivity improvement.  Not everything is perfect, but there is significant upside.  And that encouraged me more.  And of course I have to accept that we have some extra costs which we didn't plan for.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Nomura - Analyst    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes and I guess you'd be much more worried if you rolled it out and it wasn't bringing the benefits in.  So it might cost a little bit more and take a bit longer but still gets you the benefit then the ROI is still easily worth it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [93]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So we have not found any major roadblocks.  And I ask always the same question.  Whenever we have our steering committee, I ask the question can we sell and the answer has been from now five countries, yes, we can sell the product, the customer is accepting that.  We have to change the sequence of steps we have to do.
Do we see productivity improvement?  Yes, we see productivity improvement.  Of course can we collect the money because that's important as well.  And we have some challenges in all three areas.  But in principle we see that it's heading in the right direction.  And I always say we can't go only the next step enlarging this system to more countries if we are getting every time better with the underlying processes.  And that's the normal procedure.
But I haven't seen any roadblock in any of these dimensions which -- where I would say it's completely out of the market or the productivities are not working or the system has no performance and whatsoever.  So none of these things we have experienced so far despite that we have adapted already certain things because of course you do pilots to learn something from it and not take it for granted that everything is right in the first place.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Nomura - Analyst    [94]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So it's just simply a question of timing and a bit more OpEx than you had anticipated in a relatively aggressive budget when you started the program, yes?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [95]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Nomura - Analyst    [96]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's great.  Thank you both very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [97]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Well, that brings us to basically to the end of the time slot that we have.  We've got appointments following on now among which is to see at least some of you out there on the road-showing days we're going to do now.  So with that, we're looking forward to that and let me hand over to Frank Appel for his closing remarks.  Please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [98]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Martin.  Thank you for listening today.  I think we had to deliver a quite complex message back on a very strong quarter and confirming that we will make this year's guidance.
I think we do what you should expect from the management to do that we are doing the right thing in forwarding and supply chain to improve the margins and the growth potential of both divisions.  That will lead to additional cost particularly in the next year and that's the reason why we said we will give you a new guidance for 2015 in precise numbers later and not today.
But at the same time we want to demonstrate our confidence that these activities will lead to a further step-up of our profitability in 2016 as a solid step into the direction of 2020.  So we are -- feel very confident that what is on the road now in our minds at the moment for this year, next year and beyond should help us and give us the possibility to deliver not only this year's numbers, but also next year's and 2016 and of course 2020 numbers.
We see a lot of opportunities in all four business units and we felt that as a senior management team it's right to tell the market that we need some money to do that.  We don't want to change in going away again from reported numbers.  And all the numbers we have got today will be reported numbers despite that we have one-time effects once in a while which we will of course explain.  But we will not deduct them and have an underlying number because we think it's better to report the reported numbers.  And all the guidance numbers are of course reported numbers.
So with that, I hope that we could answer all your questions and again thank you very much for listening to our call today.
