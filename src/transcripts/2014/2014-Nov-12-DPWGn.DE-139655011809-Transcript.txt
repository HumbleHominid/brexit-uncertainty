Presentation

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Deutsche Post DHL conference call regarding the DPDHL third-quarter results 2014.  (Operator Instructions).  Let me now turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Martin Ziegenbalg.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you and a warm welcome to anyone out there for our Q3 2014 conference call.
As scheduled, I've today here with me our group CEO, Frank Appel, and our group CFO, Larry Rosen, who will take you through the presentation as you have it in front of you.  And as always, there will be sufficient time for Q&A after that.
And without further ado, I'd like to hand over to you, Frank, please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  Good afternoon as well from my side.  So, let me do two things, that I give you a little bit of highlights on what we have achieved in Q3 and then talking about our direction until 2020.
So, if we turn to page 3, these are the highlights of the quarter.  We have seen a very strong quarter again from Express, not only by significant growth but also by margin improvement.  Also PeP and supply chain have positively contributed to the EBIT growth we have seen in the quarter.  And with NFE we continued entering the implementation phase of our transformation program.
So, on that basis, we are very confident that we can deliver the numbers for this year and also can reconfirm the targets we have given you in August this year for 2016.
Overall, we believe that we are in an attractive industry and can grow our business further until 2020.  We believe that e-commerce in particular is in a very interesting market, but overall the logistics industry is attractive too.  We are well positioned and we believe that we can not only grow but also enlarge our margin.  So we believe that we can deliver what we have promised until 2020.
If we go to the next page we see the quarter results.  We had a good quarter with good growth on the top line, as much on EBIT and even more on the net profit side where we have enlarged the profitability by 17%, also helped by the financial result and the tax rate.  So, year to date we are nicely up as well despite that we had currency challenges in the first half and on the EBIT now close to 5% and net profit is even more up.
Page 5 shows you as well that this quarter has, or this year has delivered for the first time in three years that all divisions have grown faster than the global GDP.  Of course, our stars here are -- remain the parcel business and the Express TDI product.  But also you see in supply chain another year so far growing faster the revenue than the overall GDP.  And on the air freight and ocean freight side we have seen nice growth as well for the first time after we had a challenging year last year with regard to volume.  So overall we believe that this is, from a growth perspective, a good sign that we are really well positioned with all our divisions in the respective markets.
On page 6 you see as well that we have continued to deliver in most parts against our goals.  The EBIT target we have set in 2009 for PeP, EUR1b is nicely outperformed since a while.  We are shooting this year again for EUR1.3b after we had restated the 2013 number where we included now the e-commerce companies and the domestic parcel companies who transferred -- that was close to that, so we think that we can deliver this year the same number.
On the right side, you see that two divisions have continuously improved their margins, the express division and the supply chain.  If you look more on a quarterly basis since 2010, we had for a longer period increases well in DGF but since we have started the transformation we are challenged as well with extra cost.  But also with having focused on -- continued to fight for business in the market and in the same time we have to reorganize our structures to set up for the new system and the new processes.  So overall we have seen a good development in the first nine months of this year.
If I come then to the longer-term outlook on page 8, you see a repeat of our Capital Market Day earlier this year when we disclosed our new strategy 2020.  There's nothing on that which is new, it's the same aspiration.  We want to remain focused on our four divisions in a way of a family of divisions to improve our margins.  We want to connect the different parts of the organization more to improve service quality and we want to grow particularly for the e-commerce and the focus of the emerging markets, faster than the overall GDP.  And that should lead to a significant increase of our EBIT based on last year's numbers of in total 8% and that combines or is a combination of 3% growth in PeP and a 10% CAGR in the DHL division.
Why do we believe that is possible, is as seen on page 9.  We believe that our industry will grow in most part at or slightly more than the worldwide GDP that is express and supply chain, and at or slightly lower in ocean freight and slower in air freight.  But through our major programs we have in place which is in express with continuous focus on our TDI product, improving the service quality supported by the certified international specialist program, we believe that we can continue to grow and outpace the market.
With the forwarding business we believe that we can close up with our margins mid-term to our best competitors, namely Kuehne & Nagel.  And in supply chain with the standardization, overhead leverage and focus on contract portfolio management we believe that we can enlarge the margin as well.  I will come to that later on.  So, overall this is the basis why we believe the DHL divisions can deliver the 10% CAGR.
Some evidence for the successes as well, seen on the next page for the express division.  We have gained significant market share in that industry.  We were equal market leader with FedEx in 2010 and we have now almost one-third more market share than FedEx which is I think a great result of the great work Ken and his team has done here.  So we are now distant leader and UPS kept the market, TNT slightly went down, but overall we are the only one really gaining market share.  And I think that will continue because we will remain focused what made us strong.
On page 11, you see the goals and what we have seen so far from the NFE, I think that is reassuring only what we've told you already in the last quarter.  It is a difficult journey without a doubt.  We are facing some challenges but in principle we believe the system is working, we have seen that in the five pilot countries.  We see as well that the customer service is the right approach, we have structured it.  We get more transparency, but on the other side we still have not full deployment, one thing of the processes in all the countries we have seen.
So, we need more training and that will bring some additional cost and more patience, people have to learn that the environment is now very different.  But overall we believe that we can continue with the ocean freight rollout continuously and if that's done then we will follow up with air freight and I think that's a prudent approach.  But overall we are confident from all what we have seen that this is the right measure to really mid-term improve our margin significantly.
Supply chain you see on the top left on page 12 that we continued to improve our ROCE including the charges for goodwill.  So we earned our cost of capital now in the fourth year in a row, at least.  We have a very balanced portfolio between the different elements of Supply Chain.  And we will explain tomorrow more why we have a new margin target 4% to 5% until 2020.  John Gilbert and his team will do that tomorrow in London.  It's also available by webcast, as you can see here.  We believe that we have the right strategy to really go for that margin and he will explain his team tomorrow more.
On page 13 coming to the PeP division, you see already how much we are rebalancing the importance of the parcel having not even 20% in 2010 it's now more than one-third.  Of course including as well the transferred domestic parcel companies, but you see on the right as well that we have a very nice run in Germany as well, where we gain every year market share and in a fast growing market.  So this is all a strong signal that the strategy to really focus on the parcel and to support the e-commerce world is working well now at least.
On page 14 you see only an appetizer of how big the opportunity I think is many dimensions.  First, all the markets will grow significantly per volume per capita.  But on the other side you see as well that Germany has already the highest density.  And that shows you opportunity, because there is no doubt that the other markets will follow soon to get to higher levels even if they not catch up by 2020 based on our prediction.  But we believe that there is a huge potential for the e-commerce world and we will continue to upgrade our structure -- infrastructure accordingly to really capture most of that.
Examples of that, what we have done already in 2014 is on page 15.  We have already, after the transfer activities in four countries in Europe, quite sizable operation with 8,000 employees.  We have already started to deploy more activities like more parcel shops in other countries.  We deployed the first pack stations in the Netherlands.  We have improved our service in the Netherlands.  You all can read that.
But we are really working to enlarge our activities by using our expertise in Germany and deploying them in other markets.  And I have no doubt that we will see next years already the benefits of that.  We have already first encouraging signs by winning some customers we tried to win already before but they didn't come to us, because they said you are not fully committed.  That has now changed and therefore the perception of customers has changed as well, and that of employees too.
So overall before I hand over to Larry, with our basic concept that you always have to go from one S curve to the next, we are continuing to deploy our Strategy 2015 but we are now really preparing as our outline in some elements the next step of our journey.  We in total believe, or in summary believe we are an attractive healthy industry.  We are well positioned with our portfolio.  We have a very straightforward strategy to capture the potential and therefore we are very confident based on all what we are doing at the moment we definitely can deliver not only this year's numbers, 2016, but also 2020.
And with that, thank you for listening and, Larry, you will now give more detail on the numbers.  Thank you for listening.

Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - Finance Global Business Services    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, thanks and good afternoon, good morning to those joining from the Americas, I want to continue the presentation focusing now on our financial performance for the quarter and finish up with the review of our guidance for the full-year.  So, turning over to page 18 and our Group P&L, yes, Frank already mentioned that reported revenues were up by 4.1%.  This was supported by a mild boost from foreign exchange effects for the first time in a long time but with contributions also from all of the divisions.
Organic growth top line for the quarter was 3.3%.  EBIT increased by almost 5%, a solid operating profit increase in the current low-growth environment.  Due to the good Group operating performance but then also lower tax expenses and the improved financial result, due primarily to the low interest rate environment, our consolidated net profit increased by a very strong 17% in the quarter.
On page 19 is a summary of our cash flow performance.  We had some phasing effects on both provisions and working capital.  Overall operating cash flow was strong with EUR814m of operating cash flow in the quarter and reflects the usual seasonal pattern of a much stronger third and then an even stronger fourth quarter compared to the first two quarters of the year.  CapEx increased due to increased spending, especially on our parcel infrastructure and also the Express network, both the air network and the ground network.  We remain confident that we'll generate sufficient free cash flow to more than cover the dividend that we paid in May of this year as we've been guiding all year.
Then onto page 20 you see the balance sheet movement and our net debt position.  We ended the quarter with net debt of EUR2.66b which was about EUR300m below the level that we had in Q2, you see that on the right side of the chart.  And of course we also expect the further significant reduction in net debt in Q4 reflecting the seasonally strong free cash flow generation that we typically have in the last quarter of the year.
We're also pleased during the quarter to have received a credit rating upgrade during the quarter from Moody's where our senior debt is now at A3 having increased from Baa1.
Now, let's take a look starting on page 21 with our -- at our divisional performance and we'll start with PeP.  Letter volumes declined by 2.3% in Q3 in line with our average expectations following several quarters of nearly flat or even slightly positive volume growth supported by some one-off events.  An example of that is reflected in the decline in dialogue marketing where last year we had the additional mail volume caused by the federal elections in Germany which we of course didn't have again this year.  The division benefitted from the continued strong growth in the German parcel business as the shift towards online commerce continues with 8.5% volume growth in the quarter.
On page 22 we see the summary financial performance for the division where revenues increased due to the mentioned volume trends in parcel, as well as the price increase from the beginning of this year on stamps.  EBIT increased by around 4% in the quarter but continues generally to be held back by factor cost increases, in particular labor costs.  Strong operating cash flow reflects EBIT performance as well as positive working capital developments.  And CapEx -- and the CapEx increase mainly reflects investments in the parcel infrastructure.
On page 23 we turn to the express division and once again strong volume growth in the division's international time definite shipments or TDI was the main factor fueling the revenue improvement, with further gains in the core TDI business.  Especially noteworthy was the strong growth in Middle East, Africa, which is just an example of our continuing strong focus on emerging markets.
Then on page 24 we see the financial performance for express where revenues increased from EUR2.9b to EUR3.1b or 7.6% increase.  Organic revenue growth was significant, up almost 8% and reflected good growth in all regions.  EBIT increased by almost 23% benefitting strongly from the increased TDI volume and higher efficiency and scale effects in both our aviation and ground networks.   The EBIT margin increased by 1.2% or 120 basis points year over year to 9.8%.  Operating cash flow also increased strongly due to the EBIT increase and also good working capital management.  And CapEx increased due to more investments towards hub and gateway infrastructure as well as fleet modernization and expansion.
Turning now to DGF, as you can see we had for the first time in a long while some good volume growth in air freight reflecting some recovery overall in the industry, but also our success in winning some new business and focusing on sectors with higher growth.  Ocean freight also had healthy growth again in the third quarter, margins however remain at historically low levels as air and ocean carriers have been more effective at reducing excess capacity and the still low growth rates from a historical perspective result in an intensely competitive environment for the forwarding industry overall.  We continue the step-by-step implementation of NFE after our first country pilot and remain focused on this transformation as we expect to see benefits already in 2016.
Page 26 you see that the division revenues rose by 2.7% to EUR3.8b and that represents the first revenue increase since Q4 of 2012.  Improvements versus past quarters are reflecting continued volume recovery in air and ocean freight and we see much of that recovery being driven by Asia in -- especially in the air freight sector.  Gross profit declined by around 2% reflecting FX effects and the aforementioned competitive markets.  EBIT declined significantly as lower GP levels combined with higher overhead spending, including high NFE-related costs.  Operating cash flow was down consistent with the lower EBIT and also reflecting some increases in working capital.  And the CapEx increase is also as a result primarily of the NFE implementation.
Turning now to the supply chain division, we recorded a quite good third quarter with growth in revenues and EBIT and we won some attractive new business.  Revenue was impacted as we did not renew a contract with one large customer in North America, so organic revenue growth for the quarter was only around 1%.  Nevertheless at EUR285m for the quarter new business wins remain well on track to exceed EUR1b for the full-year, our minimum target that you're probably familiar with that we have each and every year.  In Q3 our strongest revenue growth were in the automotive and life science, and healthcare sectors.
And looking at supply chain financial performance, the reported revenues again were up by about 4% to almost EUR3.7b and that was supported by FX effects, but also good growth in emerging markets.  On an organic basis the growth again was about 1%.  EBIT increased almost 10% reflecting an increase in volumes and new business start-ups with higher margin levels.  CapEx was slightly lower than last year, but this is really just phasing effects.
And now I want to turn to a review of our guidance on page 30 and today we again confirm our full-year 2014 guidance of EBIT of EUR2.9b to EUR3.1b.  Each of the individual guidance components is also confirmed and we continue to expect 2015 EBIT performance to be significantly better than 2014.  Our intention is to give concrete guidance for 2015 at our full-year analyst conference which will be in early March of next year.
For 2016 we expect to achieve a Group EBIT of EUR3.4b to EUR3.7b of which somewhat more than EUR1.3b will be contributed by PeP.  DHL is planned to contribute EUR2.45b to EUR2.75b, corporate center the costs should remain around EUR350m, also our target for 2015, and although the macroeconomic environment remains volatile and below historical growth levels, we're confident to achieve all of these goals.
Well, summing up on page 31, the good Q3 performance shows that we're well on track with our strategy 2020 as Frank Appel also talked about.  All of our divisions are leaders in their industries and are well positioned for the next years.  The ongoing high investments in supply chain and DGF affect our short-term performance but are necessary to achieve our full potential in the medium and long-term and therefore are absolutely the right things to do.  Aspects of our strategy 2020 are well into execution and our Group guidance again for 2014 to 2016 is confirmed while we set the course for 2020 and our goal to define the logistics industry.
Thanks very much for your attention.  Just another reminder, on page 32 of our Capital Markets Tutorial on the Supply Chain business, I will host the session but the main part will be presented by John Gilbert and his team.  And we look forward to that very much.  If you're not able to personally attend you can follow it live by webcast and that will also be available for replay after the meeting.  So hopefully we will see you tomorrow in London.  Thanks very much.

Questions and Answers

(Operator Instructions).  Stephen Furlong, Davy Research.

Hi, there Larry, hi there, Frank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - Finance Global Business Services    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Stephen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen Furlong,  Davy Research - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just three questions maybe to Larry more.  Could you talk again, I obviously saw Moody's upgraded you, but just talk again about capital structure, because if you have a good fourth quarter as you say the free cash flow should cover the dividend.  But I'm struggling to see where the excess will be there, maybe leverage is pretty similar to what you had last year.
The second thing, it was a very low tax rate this year as you said, helped by tax losses carried forward.  Can you make some general comment about the next couple of years or just generally as you see -- I guess the tax rate's going to go back up again.
And just finally with lower fuel prices, I was just wondering what the effect of that is on the express division, maybe it helps costs, but also the surcharges come down on the revenue side or timing on that, that would be great.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - Finance Global Business Services    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, let me take a shot at all three of those.  So, yes, so we were very pleased with the Moody's upgrade they had us for a very long time on positive outlook.  I think that our cash flow performance last year, the robust strategy in their view that we announced early this year was certainly helpful.  And our financial performance in the first-half of the year was also helpful and we like to be at A3.  But as you also know our long-term target is BBB+ and we're perfectly happy to also be a BBB+ and don't need to be A rated.  It's not our target to be A rated and we're fine with being BBB+.
We think that the financial profile that we have and most important the financial profile that one can pretty easily forecast based on our current performance and the growth that we have in our businesses and our strategic position certainly supports an improving outlook as we have told you about in the Strategy 2020 discussion.  So I think all those things came together in Moody's logic and you can read their opinion and reasoning for doing the upgrade.  It's something that we expected and we're happy with it, but again we're also perfectly happy to be high BBB.
In terms of the low tax rate it's being driven very much by being able to activate tax loss carry-forwards that we incurred in the now somewhat distant past, much having to do with the exit from the US domestic express business.  And so we're happy to be able to continue our good performance and that really is what leads to being able to activate more and more of those tax loss carry-forwards.  There are more to activate so that if we're able to continue to improve performance that will have a positive effect in the future on our tax rate.  So, we'll give a concrete forecast for 2015 again in March when we announce all the other aspects of guidance.  But we're happy to have been able to take advantage of the activations we could do this year leading to the 16% effective tax rate and we hope that we will be able to continue to take advantage of the tax loss carry-forwards going forward.
So, lower fuel prices have different impacts on the different divisions.  In the network divisions and express and in forwarding we mostly pass on both higher and lower fuel prices directly to customers.  And while there's some minor lag of one or two months usually over time we're passing on virtually all of the increases or decreases onto customers.  Different are the PeP business and the supply chain business where we do have some small advantages.  It's a relatively small part of the cost base for both those businesses but we do get some minor advantages when fuel prices are going down and disadvantages when fuel prices are going up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tobias Sittig,  MainFirst - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, Tobias Sittig from MainFirst.  I've got four questions if I may, three for Larry and one for Frank.  Firstly, on the CapEx could you clarify the EUR1.9b gross, I think there was some run-over from last year, does that come on top?  Or will the gross number really be EUR1.9b, i.e. will there be spillover to next year then?  Or how should we look at that?
The second one, supply chain, you've been alluding to some extra costs you're going to take next year.  Could you give us some idea of whether that's EUR50m, EUR100m, EUR150m, what is the magnitude that we should at least count in our models here?
Thirdly on cash flows, when you add up the divisional cash flows that you give us it's roughly EUR1b operating cash flow, there must EUR200m negative in the corporate center.  Could you elaborate on why this is so negative and what's the cash flow profile of the corporate center at the moment?
And the last one for Frank, on forwarding it's a bit a black for us whether NFE is a success or not and you're pretty close to what?s happening.  Can you expand a little on how the morale is?  We hear of some teams leaving a little bit dissatisfaction.  On the other hand the project seems to be up and running quite well.  Can you give a little bit of your experience over the past couple of weeks and months on the forwarding implementation please?  Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
May I start even with that ,Tobias, so such a transformation is of course a huge challenge and being close to that, as you said, we have not really seen massive attrition of people.  We have seen concerns in the organization that this is really a change of the way how the management is working and the employees are working.  And therefore we have a significant distraction from what is important to do for the customers every day.
But if I talk to country managers, and I was just in two countries recently, what I hear from them is very clear, Frank, what we are doing here is so right.  And they say, what we have seen or what our people is telling us who have worked for competitors, this is really world class.  The challenge is more from -- coming from this are moving from this side of the river to the other side.  And that's a cultural change program, it's a transformation program that needs a lot of attention from the senior team to help them to move over the bridge.
But all what I hear, when I go to countries, from country managers who say, if I see what the system can do, it's fantastic, it really will improve our customer service quality without a doubt, but it will be challenging until it's all stable again.  And that's the reason why we take the step-by-step approach, not to really create too much challenges at the same time.  So I feel very encouraged on one side, knowing that there is enormous positive momentum.
Also when we talk to the -- which we have done -- our communication people to the shop floor level, nobody is arguing about the change, they are more concerned what it means for them personally and how fast it can work and what potential impact for the customers are.  And that's very human and very natural.  And that's -- it's challenging and that needs a lot of attention from Roger, in particular, and his team but also from myself and Larry.  We watch that very carefully.
I feel encouraged by what I hear from the bottom up.  And sometimes I feel myself challenged how slow, really, adaption to new processes are working.  So it's a matter of discipline following new processes.  It's not a question of -- what we are doing is right, how fast we are getting from this side of the river to the other takes longer than we originally planned.  And that's the reason why we changed, as well, the guidance, what we can do, when.
So -- but as I said, I was in two countries and talked to the country managers who were involved in  training the trainer and all this kind of stuff to say, Frank, this is superb and if you talk to employees from our best competitors, and we have them, they say, this is really fantastic and that it will make a huge difference for the industry.
So it's -- I can imagine it's frustrating when you listen to that but that's what we hear, really.  It's a challenge but it's very encouraging when you hear and talk to the people on the shop floor level and in the countries.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tobias Sittig,  MainFirst - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's very helpful, thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - Finance Global Business Services    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, so let me try to answer the first couple of questions.  So yes, the EUR1.9b of CapEx is CapEx that we will book this year.  We think that the spending pattern will be somewhat more normalized than last year.  There was, in the fourth quarter of last year, an unusual amount of CapEx that was booked but paid in the first quarter of this year.
We don't expect to have such a big effect like that this year.  So that EUR1.9b is still the target for gross CapEx.  There's always going to be a little bit that spills over in terms of spending and cash flow into the next year, but we don't expect that it to be an extreme case like we had this year where there was probably around EUR200m of extra spending in the first quarter of this year that related to CapEx that we'd booked at the end of last year.
So for supply chain -- and we'll talk about this tomorrow also in the tutorial -- we expect the net EBIT impact of maximum EUR100m as a result of the restructurings that we're doing in the division.  So I think that answers your question.
And in terms of cash flows for the corporate center, I think you're talking about corporate center and consolidation and this is where we are booking all of our taxes paid.  So of the EUR200m, about two-thirds of it is taxes paid so we don't book that anywhere else, or about EUR130m out of the EUR200m.  And the rest is actual spending on corporate center expenses for the staff in the corporate center.

Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, Damian, we can hear you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, good.  Three questions, please.  First of all, just on the global forwarding business.  Could you give us any idea of what the underlying overhead inflation there was?  I know you're sometimes reticent to talk about that but if there's any clues you can give, that would be useful.
Secondly, on the express business.  There was a comment in the presentation, at least on the written one, about active yield management.  Could you tell us a little bit more about what's going on there, how that's being managed?   Are you focusing more on customer contribution and volume?  And how does that trade off against, for example, the investments you've made in capacity at some of your hubs like East Midlands, Leipzig and elsewhere in the Americas and Asia?
And then very finally, just, Larry you mentioned again that you have some presently unrecognized tax losses in the business that could be activated.  Are there any time limits on when those would be activated? Or can those last, in theory, in perpetuity?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - Finance Global Business Services    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well what I -- do you want to take the first, I'll take the second?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, okay.  Maybe I start then we have -- with express.  Yes, we have done that for quite a while that we are, of course, looking constantly into the profitability of customers and trying to optimize that.  And despite that we have done that and have taken out some customers, we have grown the business at the speed we did.  And you probably have seen that we again announced globally an increase in prices.
So we believe that the service quality makes it possible that we can grow and gain market share and nevertheless do the right thing by all the operating customers (technical difficulty).  And therefore we are sure that on a very constant base, I think Ken and his team have developed a very sophisticated approach to that.  I don't want to tell you more in detail because that is something which is a competitive advantage.
But from the detail, I think they are very sophisticated identifying what is really the contribution of customers and how you manage that.  And then taking these kind of actions.  And the willingness of countries to follow that is quite high.  That -- you see all the nice things -- if you are successful, you see all the nice things coming.  The countries are more willing to follow [central] instructions about these things because they see that it has worked out so much.
Therefore there is quite an active leadership of yield management in place.  And that has helped, without a doubt, to improve the margin.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - Finance Global Business Services    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so let me take the other two questions.  The tax loss carry-forwards. The first ones that expire, and it's only a relatively small part, are in 2020.  And then they go for years, in some cases many years after 2020.  So we have quite a good chance, now, over the next years to try to capture more of the benefits from those so far not yet activated tax loss carry forwards.
So in global forwarding, if I could interpret what you mean by underlying overhead inflation.  I assume you mean the very significant EBIT decline in comparison to the relatively mild decline in gross profit.  And of course we have the narrowly-defined NFE project costs which year over year were not really much higher, didn't change much at all compared to last year.  But certainly there are other effects in a broader sense from that significant transformation project.  And in Q3, there were a couple of smaller additional one-time items.  We had one bad debt issue for mid-single-digit millions.  So there were a couple of one-time items in Q3 that inflated a little bit the EBIT decline.
But overall, most of the issue is the transformation program that we're doing.  And yes, we are doing everything we can to minimize those expenses but that's been the experience in Q3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  And could I ask just one follow on?  Given that the profile we're seeing in NFE and forwarding, when we think about supply chain, should we think of the very similar up-front loaded cost to establish change in that business?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - Finance Global Business Services    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I think -- so if what you mean by up front is that most of the costs will occur now in the next few quarters then I think the answer is yes.  And by the time we get to 2016, we'll expect to see significant net benefits from the investments that we make in restructuring.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And second to that, I think the change in supply chain is less fundamental.  The difference is that we are not changing every -- in every place the way how we work.  In supply chain, it's more, take the best we've got.  And take it as a standard.   And that's a very different approach.  I believe that the new leadership team around John is very committed.  You will definitely hear that from some of the colleagues tomorrow beyond John.  They are very committed to do that.
I think John did a nice job in moving some of the people also from regions and functions and from regions -- from functions and regions.  And I think that creates the right sentiment in the top.  So I think the challenge in supply chain is different than in [DGF].  Nevertheless, some of the costs, like if you delayer the organization, then you have the costs immediately.  So they will materialize at the beginning.  Or if you really try to get out of a certain business in anyway, the cost -- in the businesses, the cost will come at the beginning as well.
So therefore we are very confident with the change that we will see significant impact next year.  But then we should see significant improvement afterwards too.  And that is a less fundamental change than what we are doing in DGF for sure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [24]

Thank you very much.  And I look forward to tomorrow.

Andy Chu, Deutsche Bank London.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andy Chu,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, everyone.  Just a couple of questions for me, please.  Just in terms of your statement for 2015, although not quantified for outlook and you talk about a significant increase in EBIT, I guess that you will absorb the EUR100m of net cost for supply chain restructuring.  And if we just assume, say, the midpoint of your 2014 guidance of EUR3b, I guess significant would mean at least 5% uplift in profitability, which would then imply EUR150m in addition to the EUR100m of restructuring cost.  So could you just confirm that's the right way of looking at the bridge to 2015?   That actually you need to grow your EBIT by EUR250m to show significant improvement in terms of 2015 EBIT?
And secondly, in terms of the parcels business, could you just elaborate as to why you've seen some very good acceleration in parcel volume growth?   And maybe any comments over changes in the competitive environment?  Particularly interested in DPD that has won some of the Amazon Prime business and it's obviously one of your large customers.  And why they potentially went with DPD versus your very high quality parcels product.  Many thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so let me start with the parcel and then, Larry you will talk about our guidance, I think, very clearly.  So with regard to the parcels, I believe that we continue to really gain market share.  And there is, of course, certain volatility over the quarters.  How much a market is growing.   We have introduced a lot of sophistication and service quality into the market and therefore we believe that we can continue to grow.  And we said already that we believe the market will grow 5% to 7% until 2020 and that means we should grow at least that, if not even more, if we continue to gain market share.
The introduction of DPD, we can't change if competitors are entering the market.  And I'm afraid they put a very attractive offer on the place which was obviously compelling to one of our customers.  If they can really do with their structures what we are doing is to be seen.  I think B2C is significantly different from B2B and that's the heritage of DPD.  So we will see how successful really can keep a promise of the prime product as we can.
We have seen always that customer went away and came back with -- we've never lost a customer completely but -- of big scale at least -- and many of them came back because they saw that the competitors have not delivered as promised.  But you can't avoid that customers are trying new suppliers if they are committed to do something.  And I have no doubt that they made an offer which they couldn't refuse and we were not willing to go that price as well.    Because we believe that we deliver great value and if somebody else is really believing that he can bring the same value for significant lower cost then let's try -- they should try.  And they -- I have no doubt that they will have chances with that and the customers will come back and say, okay, we better pay your price instead of giving up your price up front.
So we have to take the risk once in a while.  If they really want to deliver for Prime, that means a significant challenge for the delivery guys of our competitor because they are not used to that.  We talked about the challenge of DGF, not every DPD courier is used to deliver to households.  And that is a significantly different game than going to the back office of customers -- B2B customer.s   So we will see what that -- how that works out.  But we are not willing to go for any price just to for any price just to keep the business.  And I hope that you support that that we are not just compromising on yield continuously just to keep everything.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - Finance Global Business Services    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So let me talk about the significance question.  And at the risk of being a bit frustrating, I think we don't want to try to define the word significantly more exactly than we've already talked about.  So we will announce concrete guidance for the full-year 2015 in early March, when we announce the full-year 2014 results.
What I will say is that significant increase takes into account and is net of those additional investments that we are doing in DGF and supply chain.  And we think including those investments, we still will be able to achieve a significant increase.  But I think we don't want to define it any more finely than that at this point.

Christopher Combe, JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Combe,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon everyone, a couple of questions.  First of all, can you clarify on the supply chain EUR100m maximum.  Is that OpEx only or is that inclusive of any associated CapEx?
And with respect to NFE, when you talked about comparable year-on-year direct costs, does that include the additional costs associated with training and data migration?
And lastly, with respect to the pension liability, it continues to expand and looks like it may expand further by year end.  How does that impact your thoughts on cash contributions?  Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - Finance Global Business Services    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So let me take certainly the first and the third of those questions.  So the EUR100m is primarily OpEx, or virtually all OpEx and very little CapEx.  And you should not interpret this figure as a forecast that the supply chain operating income is going to be EUR100m lower than it is this year.  The investment that we're making, again, will have a net EBIT impact of EUR100m but of course we expect some organic improvement in the underlying business.
So pension funding is -- seems to be a popular topic on third quarter analyst calls these days.  And frankly, the change that seemed more innocent in the accounting standard back in 2012, IAS 19R has turned out to have very significant impact on the level of balance sheet liabilities for pensions.  Nevertheless, it really doesn't change our outlook at this point in time in terms of funding the pension further.  A turnaround in interest rates which we inevitably will see at some point in the future under the current accounting standard will send the pension liability down, or the unfunded liability down as fast as it's gone up.  And so we're hesitant to do further very major funding when that's the case.
So yes, it's increased even by another EUR1b in Q3 and over EUR2b for the year, the unfunded liability.  It does not make us necessarily think about doing more funding just because the liability is increasing.
So the NFE projects costs do for the most part include training and data migration.  So the project work and the project team itself, yes those are included in the underlying NFE costs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Combe,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, and just a follow up.  Does that imply then that most of what we're seeing in terms of incremental pressure is indirect costs, inefficiencies in dealing with volume growth, etc?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - Finance Global Business Services    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  And also in -- at least in part, or in most part, associated with the overall preparation for the transformation and the implementation and go-live of the NFE system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Combe,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [36]

Neil Glynn,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, good afternoon, everybody.  Just one question from me, please, on express.  The division seems set to hit its 10% margin, or to hit a 10% margin in 2014.  Just makes me wonder as to how likely you are to set new medium-term targets in terms of margin or even returns?  Even just to ensure you get maximum performance internally as TDI market leader?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so we have not given guidance on that and we of course will be.  But I -- you know our Ken so Ken will not lay back and say, oh now we have 10% it's fine.  He'll definitely want to climb further up.   So therefore I think we don't even have to put a tough target out, he will go for the maximum anyway, whatever he can make it happen.  And that's very clear for me.
So we will discuss internally what we want to say going forward.  But you should be very reassured that Ken is not the person or the character who says, oh I achieved now the goal which was completely out of imagination, I think, when he started the journey.  Where -- when he had said at that time we will make 10% people probably had said, Ken you are crazy.
So I believe that he will go for the extra mile because he still sees opportunity to improve further and to gain market share.  So I think I would like to ask you for some patience that we will tell you at the right time.  But you should not feel uncomfortable that if somebody says, I made everything I can and now I relax and enjoy, that's not his character.  And I would not allow that anyway if that would be his character.  So because I think we can do more than we have achieved so far.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matija Gergolet,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, hello, good afternoon.  The first question would be more about the PeP business.  I think on page -- it's page 16 -- no, 15, you're showing that you are now focusing more now also on the Netherlands, Belgium, Czech Republic, Poland, with the parcel business being moved into the PeP.  Can you just a little bit elaborated whether or not you see that more as a most-intense focus on PeP  B2C in this market?  Or just a more efficient focus?  I.e. you see that within the PeP this is going to drive higher margins?
Secondly on -- well, on the pension liabilities, can you remind us what was the discount rate at the end of the quarter for your pension liabilities?  How low are we at the moment?
And just thirdly, one more on the financials.  I saw that in Q3 you had around EUR300m provision outflows.  Could you just elaborate a little bit on what was it?  I think it was quite material.   And perhaps also provide any guidance for the rest of the year or for next year about what we should expect in terms of provisions outflow.  Thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so the idea of the transfer of the domestic business from express in PeP is of course on the long run to increase the profitability of these businesses despite that they are nicely profitable.  But of course we want to capture more of the market.  So far they have been mainly B2B, partially B2C.  And we see a huge opportunity, as you can outline on this page, for further growth in these markets.
So we definitely will enlarge our operations and focus in addition to B2C.  We believe we can -- we know how to operate that and we will expand our scope into these areas, even if the yield will change with that because they are different customer types.  But overall, we believe that we can grow the business faster, we can gain additional scale, and that will lead to improved profitability as well.
As you know, we have not really disclosed too much about the profitability.  I can only say the businesses are profitable and have developed well.  And we have strong market positions and we will decide later on if we want to give you more information, in which way because I understand that that's important, of interest, because the more you can judge how good that business is, the more it helps the overall valuation.  But at the moment, we don't want to say more about that.  But Larry, Jurgen and I are working definitely on that theme as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matija Gergolet,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The other two subjects, I think, Larry, you're well equipped to answer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - Finance Global Business Services    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so let me start with the pension liabilities and the applicable discount rate.  The most important one and most relevant one for determining the overall unfunded position and the overall level of the liability is the one for the Eurozone.  And that's 2.5% -- was 2.5% for us at the end of Q3.  Japan, we're using around 1.5%.  The UK, 3.75%.  And the US, 4.5%.  So on seeing, now, the reports of other companies, we seem to be about in the middle if not on the slightly conservative side compared to other companies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matija Gergolet,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - Finance Global Business Services    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So in terms of provision movements, we had about EUR200m last year.  And we had EUR300m this year.  Probably about EUR100m of that should be considered as non-recurring or unusual amounts.
One of the issues related to a significant real estate project.  And you've seen the -- also the reduction in inventory.  When we hold real estate on a temporary basis and then do a development project and then again put it into a sale leaseback arrangement then if we, from the beginning have intended to hold it for only a short time then it goes into inventory and the provision movement shows the movement of that project into, then, the sale leaseback arrangement and it reduces both inventory and provision.
So you have to see the movement in working capital and the change in provisions together.  That was about two thirds of that EUR100m.  And then the other item was a, let's say, unusual reduction.  It's probably more phasing than anything else.  An amounts provision for other employee benefits such as partial retirement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matija Gergolet,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  So on going forward, what should we be expecting?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - Finance Global Business Services    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I think the usual figure is more like EUR200m.  That's what we saw in the third quarter of last year.  That's probably a more reasonable number and most of that is coming from the usual movement in pensions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matija Gergolet,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Well, thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, hello, gentlemen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - Finance Global Business Services    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, David.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A question -- a couple of questions on air freight and then one on ocean freight.  As it regards air freight, any comments you have on the current peak season out of Asia?  What October, November volumes are looking like?  Have they accelerated from the 8% tonnage growth you saw in the third quarter?
And then also is the negative GP per ton pressure improving?  Because we saw that down almost 12% in the third quarter.  I want to see if that's getting back to a more normal level with better volumes.
And then on ocean freight, the question is just around the US West Coast port slowdown and congestion.  What impact that's having both on your ocean freight and your air freight businesses?  Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so overall, it's relatively difficult to finally]judge how much of the volume growth we have seen at that peak season comes from the gains we made and how much is really driven by up trading of the markets.  I would say it's probably a combination of both.  So I think we have seen a relatively strong autumn this year, stronger than the previous year in Asia at least.
With regard to the gross profit, we have not seen an improvement, it was flattish I would say and it continues to be flattish.  So no improvement so far.
And on the third, I have not heard any major issues but maybe on the port you have heard something from our colleagues?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - Finance Global Business Services    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, I have not heard that so far it's been unusually disruptive to our business.
Now the other comment maybe on GP for the quarter to date is -- we've only seen so far one month, the October figures.  It's probably too early to draw definitive conclusions about how GP development is going to be for the whole quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, Dave?  (Inaudible)?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [62]

No, sorry, I had my phone on mute.  Are you guys clear?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - Finance Global Business Services    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There we go.  Yes, thanks, David.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [65]

Okay, operator.  Do we have any further callers out there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are no further questions left.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, well, then thank you very much and just like Larry, the whole IR team and myself are looking forward to seeing probably not all of you but hopefully many of you tomorrow on our workshop.
And let me close the call by handing over to Frank for a few closing remarks.  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I think we have demonstrated that we had another solid quarter, driven by three]well-performing divisions and one where we talked quite a bit about the challenges that DGF has.   So overall, we are very confident that we will deliver this year's guidance.  And we are equally confident that we are taking the right action to lay the foundations for longer term growth.
We are believing that we can have four divisions which are delivering best-in-class margins.  And therefore we are confident as well that it's right to invest into NFE on one side and the changes which are necessary in supply chain.
And John will explain that more tomorrow, I have no doubt, in a very (technical difficulty) way why he believes that we (technical difficulty) taking steps to improve the performance.  And that [growth] really should lead to a situation, mid-term that we really have four well-performing divisions,
And with that, I would like to thank you very much for joining us today.  And for those of you who are around tomorrow in London, I hope that you feel what John and Larry and their teams will present are quite exciting as well.  So thank you for today and see you soon or later.
