Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Kraft Foods Group fourth-quarter results conference call. 
(Operator Instructions) 
As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Jakubik. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - VP IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our quarterly business update. With me today are Tony Vernon, our CEO; and Teri List-Stoll, our CFO. During our remarks we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we think see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties. And these are discussed in our press release. 
We will also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today and you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our press release and in the investor center of KraftFoodsGroup.com. Now I will hand it over to Tony and Teri to discuss our fourth-quarter and full-year results as well as the state of our business. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Chris and thanks to everyone for joining us to discuss our 2013 results. Before we get into our usual business update, and our progress in remaking Kraft Foods, we'll start today by putting some context around the revenue growth we just reported. 
We delivered 3.2% organic topline revenue growth in the fourth quarter, well above the 0.6% growth for the North American food and beverage industry, and consistent with our guidance. We did see a benefit of about 3 percentage points from comparisons with the spin-related trade inventory deload that happened last year, and that was partially offset by about 1 point of extraordinary pruning. 
In the end I'd offer two takeaways. First, excluding the noise from the spin-related comparisons and our extraordinary pruning, our base business volume mix growth was solid. And this occurred in a quarter where our industry faced a number of headwinds from SNAP reductions, to a tight window between Thanksgiving and other holidays at the end of the year. Second, we lagged industry growth on a dollar basis due to pricing as several of our categories, mainly nuts and coffee, priced down during the year, in line with lower input costs. 
Now, turning to our full-year revenue performance, as we've talked about for most of this year, we expected that our focus on profitable growth would hold back our topline growth versus industry in 2013. What's most interesting however, is that the major disparity between our organic growth and industry growth was due to pricing. We priced down mainly to reflect lower input costs in coffee and nuts, while higher industry pricing of 1.4% represented the entirety of industry growth. In fact, our vol-mix growth was faster than industry unit growth in 2013 with or without the extraordinary pruning of less profitable product lines that we pushed hard this year. 
Now, when we look behind and beyond the topline growth numbers, we made a great deal of progress in 2013 in revitalizing and remaking the new Kraft Foods and setting the stage for further progress in 2014. We've talked a lot about rejuvenating our portfolio, brand by brand, over the course of the year. 
There were several bright spots that really delivered for us in 2013. Canada, where our team north of the border had an outstanding year, outgrowing their categories by a wide margin and delivering strong innovation-driven topline growth and more than 20% bottom line growth. The performance of our cheese business reflected great general management, coming off a 2012 that was heavy up with advertising and a lot of pricing moves and transitioning to more of a better balance of advertising and promotion this year. This resulted in the business's first year share gain in total cheese since 2005. And its third consecutive year of category leading performance on both the top and bottom lines. 
Now, no doubt 2014 will test their mettle again with spot cheese prices back at record levels at the outset of the year. But our cheese team has proven their ability to drive revenue-driven profit growth consistently. Food service, where our team lives and breathes the mantra of profitable growth, delivering a four-peat -- four consecutive years of hitting its bottom line growth targets in spite of heavy product line pruning. Coffee and Planters are two other revenue-driven profitable growth stories in the making, where innovation in coffee pots and great marketing behind Mr. Peanut and each supported by significant productivity gains to drive strong bottom-line growth. 
And Lunchables, where category growing innovation behind the launch of  Lunchables Uploaded has expanded the brand's appeal to an older teen demographic and led to strong double-digit growth all year. Now, at the same time our list of challenges has not really changed since last quarter, but we're seeing some encouraging signs of life. In cold cuts, while the category remained under pressure in Q4, our share trend improved and we will have more innovation and rejuvenation activity coming to the market this year. 
Jell-O -- while it's still early days in our in our brand renovation efforts, we did see an improvement in household penetration and shopper visits to this category in the fourth quarter. And the fact that this occurred in a seasonally low quarter for that business was encouraging. And in salad dressings, the promotional environment was much less intense than the fourth quarter and our market share showed improvement versus what we saw during the first half of the year. 
Overall, we feel great about the improvement in our portfolio health, but there is still lots more work to do. For instance, during the 52 weeks of 2013, roughly two-thirds of our businesses were holding or growing market share, up from only 40% one year ago. That's more than a 26-point improvement. That being said, going forward, our challenge is more squarely focused on growing our categories. We owe that to our customers. 
In many cases, Kraft is the category and we'll talk more about how we tackle that challenge next Tuesday at the CAGNY conference. Productivity continued to deliver at industry-leading levels, and frankly, productivity has been the key to our ability to reinvest in our brands, our marketing, and our great people. And really begin to change our game. And finally, our cash focus and return-based decision making is really paying off and is fully reflected in our financial results to date. That is a great segue to Teri's discussion on the details of our Q4 and full-year earnings performance. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Tony; and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by saying how excited I am to be here as part of the Kraft team. I'm looking forward to meeting and getting to know you over the coming months. 
As I'm sure you've seen by now, we had a solid fourth-quarter finish. For the full year, earnings were above the guidance we provided at the end of October, even after taking out the significant benefits from market-based impacts to our postemployment benefit plans. As we look at the earnings bridge, we saw a significant contribution from the growth in earnings from operations. This is consistent with our expectations and was a big contributor for both the fourth quarter and the year. 
The upside versus our guidance was primarily driven by two factors -- lower than expected spending on restructuring, and a lower than expected effective tax rate. Restructuring program costs were roughly $290 million for the year, versus the approximately $325 million we initially expected. You may recall the initial estimate for this restructuring program announced at the time of spinoff was $650 million. Right now, we expect that we will complete the program at a lower cost, call it, $625 million. 
On the tax line, we were able to realize some discrete tax benefits in 2013 that we hadn't factored into our latest guidance update. There's been two things. The first is pretty obvious, that our earnings were higher than expected in 2013. And second, because of some discrete tax benefits in 2013, we will face a slightly larger tax headwind moving forward, since our effective tax rate in 2013 was well below the approximately 34% we would expect on a going basis. 
Overall, we feel we've made significant strides in improving the profitability of our businesses. And having anniversaried the spin-related impacts, we've established a fairly solid base of earnings from which we can grow consistently going forward. And importantly, generate the cash necessary to reinvest in our businesses while returning ample cash to our shareholders. 
Which brings me to the progress we've made in improving free cash flow. As Tony mentioned, our focus on cash really paid off in 2013. We generated free cash flow of $1.5 billion. That's $300 million higher than what we had initially forecast. Working capital efficiency, especially our days inventory on hand, drove the upside versus our expectations. We ended the year with our four-quarter cash conversion cycle at approximately 34 days. This is down more than eight days compared to the four-quarter average in the prior year. 
We used approximately $600 million of our free cash flow to fund contributions to our pension plans during 2013. Together with the asset returns realized in those plans, and the increase in discount rates used to calculate our obligations, we've been able to improve the funded status of our pension plans to 96% at the end of 2013. That's a dramatic increase from a funded status of only 77% a year ago. This improvement in funded status means that we're planning our 2014 contribution a bit lower than our previous expectations, at about $200 million. 
And in anticipation of the question, we are not taking our contributions down to zero. There are two reasons for this. First, we have about $60 million of required contributions that are primarily related to our Canadian pension plans. And second, we plan to make additional contributions to offset the benefits activity that will accrue during 2014. We currently expect that to be around $140 million. 
Now, that said, the improved funded status puts us in a much better position than we were only a year ago, allowing us to deploy excess cash to grow our business and create value for shareholders. One of our opportunities is to begin share repurchases under the $3 billion program that our Board put in place last December. We haven't made any share repurchases to date, given the timing of that authorization came during one of our normal earnings-related blackout periods. 
Now taken altogether, the current health of our portfolio, the solid base of earnings we've established, and the fact that we as a Company have proven that we know how to cut costs and generate cash, we're well-positioned to deliver sustainable growth consistent with the long-term growth algorithm we've laid out. First, profitable organic revenue growth at or above the North America food and beverage industry. Second, consistent mid-single-digit growth in operating income. And third, mid- to high-single digit EPS growth. 
Keep in mind, these targets exclude market-based impacts on postemployment benefit plans. For free cash flow, you'll notice that we've refined our target here from consistent mid-single digit growth to more of a cash productivity target. Our objective is at least 90% of net income. I believe this is achievable on a sustainable basis and it sets a realistic bar relative to benchmark performance. 
Importantly, it's consistent with how we're thinking about our other objectives such as the productivity opportunities that our Head of Supply Chain, Bob Gorski, laid out for you last September. And finally, we remain committed to both consistent year-to-year improvements in ROIC and mid-single digit growth in our dividend. 
Which brings me to our guidance practices going forward. If you recall, at Kraft's first investor day presentation just before the spinoff, our team laid out the Company's intention to cease issuing annual guidance beginning in 2014. And so here we are. Let me spend just a few minutes talking about the protocol you can expect moving forward and our philosophy behind it. 
When we announced our no annual guidance policy, we said our long-term growth algorithm reflects our ongoing expectation for performance year in and year out. With consumer staples being a relatively stable industry in terms of earnings and cash flow, we believe this is a realistic expectation. Also, we need our Managers to focus on the long term and not manage to short-term estimates or consensus, which can be damaging to long-term shareholder value creation. So as a matter of practice, our current plan is to not provide annual point estimates on P&L line items. 
But you can expect us to deliver annual results consistent with our long-term growth algorithm. And as far as quarterly estimates go, as many of you know, Kraft's earnings seasonality is fairly consistent. As a standalone Company, the new Kraft's dollar revenue split is roughly 50-50 first half versus second half. And we typically generate a bit more than half of our EPS in the first half of the year. We still have some base period shifts like Easter that can skew our quarterly splits, but front-half back-half splits should be reasonably comparable. 
That's doesn't mean that we won't talk about factors that may lead to some deviation from either our long-term growth algorithm or the normal seasonality of earnings across quarters. You can expect us to provide quantitative assessments of financially material events. For instance, the impact from extraordinary product pruning and the acquisitions, or significant changes in the timing of our cost savings initiatives. 
We'll also provide quantitative assessments of business and macroeconomic trends and competitive dynamics, if we expect such factors to take us away from the consistent growth we're targeting over the long term. I'll now turn it back to Tony for some closing remarks regarding how we see 2014 shaping up. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Teri. As all of you know scanner data on consumer takeaway has shown an increasingly challenging environment over the course of 2013. I'll talk in more detail about the current trends and dynamics at work in our industry next week at CAGNY. 
But I'll say now, that as we enter 2014, we see some of those headwinds continuing in the near term for the North American food and beverage market. And we would expect unit growth to remain below population growth in the near term. 
Two specific factors affecting growth are the recent reduction in SNAP benefits and low labor market participation. Additionally, we would anticipate an especially soft start to the year for two reasons. First is calendar timing with a shift in the Easter holiday from Q1 last year to Q2 this year. For Kraft, this means a shift in revenue and quite high margin revenue of about $150 million into the second quarter of 2014, versus what occurred in the first quarter of 2013. 
Second, because of a weaker holiday sellthrough, we believe our retail customers ended this year with perhaps one more day of inventory than they normally carry. And this is likely to impact both industry growth and our growth in the first quarter of 2014. Now I'll hand it back to Teri to round out some Kraft-specific factors that will affect our earnings and cash flow. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So just to build on what Tony said was likely to be a slow start to the year, I'd also note the fact that our cheese and meats businesses will be climbing an upwards commodity cost curve at the outset of the year. And as many of you know, there tends to be some degree of quarter-to-quarter disconnect when this happens, with the price benefits flowing through to the P&L at a somewhat slower pace than the cost increases. 
Below the line, while I mentioned our lower than normal effective tax rate in 2013 and the headwind it will create moving forward, there are two other factors to consider as you think of our earnings and cash flow prospects. The first is related to our spending and cost savings initiatives. I mentioned earlier that we spent roughly $290 million on our restructuring program in 2013. We've said in the past that our ongoing rate of spending on cost savings initiatives should be in the $125 million range. 
However, due to the timing of projects that caused last year's spending to come in slightly lower than expected, as well as the mix of projects we're looking at for this year, our spending on cost savings initiatives in 2014 is likely to be higher than our normal run rate by as much as $25 million. We don't have a firm number yet and we're still finalizing some projects. But we wanted to flag it for you now and prevent a surprise later. 
So while we still expect a step down in spending to benefit both our earnings and free cash flow generation in 2014, it may not be as significant a step down as many of you might have expected. The other factor that should benefit free cash flow in 2014 versus 2013 is a lower level of pension plan contributions that I mentioned earlier. 
Now, to head off one other question that might come up, I think there may be some expectation that our growth in free cash flow in 2014 may benefit from one less tax payment than what occurred in 2013. It's true, the number of tax payments we make in 2014 may well be different than 2013. But we also will not have the tax benefit of the much larger pension contributions we made last year. So as a result, the dollar amount of taxes may not necessarily be lower than in 2013. And therefore we wouldn't expect any tax related benefits to free cash flow growth this year. And now back to Tony to close things out. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. I'll wrap up our opening comments by saying that as tough as the economy may be, and as strapped as our key consumer is, we feel confident we're on the right track. We're encouraged by the progress we've made in productivity, overheads, costs, cash flow, and market share. But we will not be satisfied until we consistently grow our portfolio of great brands faster than the North American food and beverage industry. 
Nobody likes to operate in this type of environment. And we're not yet firing on all cylinders. But I will say this -- we have an obligation and a real opportunity to innovate and contemporize our brands to meet the constantly evolving needs of all America's families. The emerging and growing cohorts of Millennials and Hispanic consumers are economically strapped consumers in this barbell economy, and those consumers seeking more options in nutrition and well-being. 
At CAGNY, I plan to talk more about how Kraft is uniquely positioned to capture these growing, yes, growing cohort opportunities. Yes, we have more work to do. But we have a playbook that's working and a portfolio like no other. We are focused and taking the right steps to build our brands, our people, and our capabilities, with a mission to deliver long-term profitable growth and strong free cash flow. Now, we'd be delighted to take your questions.

Chris Growe, Stifel. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I thought I had just -- maybe the printer had missed the outlook page from your press release but I guess you're not going to give me an outlook for the year. I get that now. Just kidding. 
I just had a question for you if I could. If you look at 2014, I guess I'm trying to get to like maybe some framing of PNOC for the year. I know it know it sounds like it will be a slow start to the year, but how pricing -- it looks like you have input cost inflation for the year? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terry List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you know, we have demonstrated a good discipline in the PNOC area, so as we look at commodity prices rising today, we're very much focused on how do we keep pace with that and respond to that in operational ways to taking the right pricing at the right time. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So you have a gross cost savings target and a net cost saving target. Is this a year where, especially when you're chasing higher input costs, there may be a little less of a gap between those two because you're using more of those cost savings to offset inflation. Is that a reasonable assumption for 2014? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terry List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're not going to get into real specific details line by line, but you can rest assured the productivity we're driving to keep that spread between growth and net as small as possible, but there's some legitimate business investments in there as well, so we'll keep focused on it and drive the net. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. If I could follow-up follow on to that one last question would be your net cost savings for the year. Are those numbers that you're giving in advance for 2014 what you expect in the way of net cost savings? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We didn't really provide any net cost savings there, Chris. I think what Terry was talking about in the opening comments had more to do with the spending on cost savings initiatives as opposed to a cost savings target if you will. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Thank you. See you next week.

Alexia Howard, Sanford Bernstein. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alexia Howard,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can I ask about uses of cash? It looks as though your net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio has come down or it looks fairly decent level at this point. How are you thinking about the share repurchases versus acquisitions versus other possible uses of cash from here? Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terry List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. As we think about the best way to deploy our cash, we start with of course making sure we have invested sufficiently within the business and of course maintain our commitment to the dividend, so those are the two primary priorities we have. We certainly have the ability to consider acquisitions but that's something that is not necessarily a primary focus at this point, which leaves us with the possibility to return some of that cash to shareholders. So we think about the share repurchase as a way to use excess cash once we've made the appropriate other investments that will help drive growth. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alexia Howard,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then on the pruning front on the sales line, is that a trend that we're going to expect to continue during the course of 2014? And how do you classify pruning as unusual or extraordinary versus the ongoing level of pruning that you would expect on a day-to-day basis? Thank you and I'll pass it on. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alexia, my goal in our remaining years together is that you never have to hear the word pruning again. It was exceptional these last two years because we were doing it primarily in food service and there was an Oscar Mayer line that we got out of. But we're going to absorb pruning in our own growth calculation. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alexia Howard,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.

Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just wanted to make sure I understood the climbing cost curve commentary. In terms of your ability to recover that through pricing, there's always a lag of sorts. I understand. 
But is there any reason to think that in the environment we're in right now or what you're seeing that that lag would be any different for whatever it is, competitive reasons, than it normally is in a category like cheese or meat? And what would you see that normalized lag as being? A couple of quarters? Two quarters? How do you see that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just comment and you've written about this a few times Andrew, we feel very good about the progress we're making in our pricing power vis-a-vis the equity and innovation investments we make in our brands. So in fact we feel good about our elasticity and our ability to use price as one of the four Ps. 
I think the best proof I can give you of late is that in the peanuts and coffee situations we grew share, we grew margin dollars, we grew top line, we grew bottom line, and we handled the pricing volatility in that situation, I believe, quite well. And I anticipate that for meats and the other businesses that are affected. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And just one quick follow-up, I think Terry mentioned the restructuring spending might be, was it $25 million higher in 2014 than you had otherwise anticipated potentially? So instead of $125 million perhaps $175 million? Is that what you were getting at? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terry List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
More like up to $150 million. Potentially as much as $25 million. We haven't finalized the project and all of that. It's still open and I just wanted to provide a little bit of advanced notice that it could be a bit higher. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. If I did my math right I would have actually gotten to your number. So thank you for that clarification. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terry List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't want to challenge you, Andrew. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [22]

Ken Goldman,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony, can you talk a bit more about the retail inventory issue, what you think happened there and which categories are most affected? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I wouldn't overstate it or over-think it. I think it was an unusual year, right? Because we had such a short number of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And so buying patterns were affected by less shopping days and that high holiday season. And I think all of us probably saw that we're sitting on maybe a day. 
I think Walmart on their call discussed it. And we saw it. I wouldn't let it run on you because I think my goal -- I've said this to you guys before is that we never have to talk about inventory because our retailers are pretty good at this, and in a growing Company, we should be able to manage these small swings. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Goldman,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks. And then Terry, first you didn't mention coffee as a cost headwind. I just wanted to know if beans were factored into your thoughts. And last year, George Zoghbi came to New York, he gave a very helpful presentation about cheese pricing and strategy. One of the points he made was that cheese EBIT can rise year on year even when cheese costs are up. And he gave 2011 as an illustration. 
Is this true, though, even in a year when cheese spikes as it had? I know it's come off the boil, but it's still pretty high. So I'm curious if your expectation is that cheese EBIT can and will be up if the cost of the commodity stays above $2.10 or so? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terry List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is -- George is right obviously. And it is as relevant today as when he was talking to you in 2011, so over time it is possible that the volatility in cheese could provide some of that opportunity. And as you can well imagine, George and his team are actively working the best way to manage through what we're seeing in the cheese pricing. 
On the coffee front, coffee prices are rallying a bit because of some of the drought conditions that we're seeing in Brazil. So that is a consideration as we head into the year, as well. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Goldman,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [28]

Great. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So many questions, so little time. Let's start out with you didn't mention your marketing spending or advertising for --  why don't we just -- I doubt I'm going to get in the quarter. So what was it up in the year and how do you think about that, I think was $600 million that you spent a year ago? Or $640 million? How much is that number up and what do think about that for 2014? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So advertising spend, I'm proud to say, was up double digits. It was low-double digits but it was double digits. You know that we feel that we're rebuilding the appropriate level of advertising. 
I think if you do the math, you'll see I'm about $0.75, $0.80 on the $1 versus my goal of fair share of advertising. And that we continue to believe that we'll march to that in 2014. We are not going to be one of the Companies that cuts equity advertising and innovation in favor of plowing into the trade, and I think if you really tease out fourth quarter, you'll see we maintained our growth rate. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Thanks for that. And then Tony, you mentioned that Canada was doing very well, and the profit numbers in the year and the quarter back that up. But should we be concerned about the possible price war up there among some retailers? Is that a factor that could limit your results during the year? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I think the reality is, as you know, there are five accounts that dominate the market. We happen to do best with the biggest of those five, who have a three-tiered strategy in private label that's very successful, but that's the account where we actually do our best performance. And so I'm very confident that their playbook of innovation and their use of the entire good, better, best spectrum is their going to do -- they're going to continue the momentum they showed in 2013. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Last one and then I'll pass it on. 
Again, looking at the cheese business, you had been running, as best I can tell from the numbers, roughly $170 million to $180 million, $190 million per quarter in profit, but this quarter really rolled over to $150 million. What was the reason for that? And is that maybe an example of the timing between higher cheese cost versus pricing? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm sorry. Eric, what was the context on the numbers you were throwing out? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was saying that you've been running excluding charges and other things which you know I like to do, it's been running about $180 million to $190 million, $200 million a quarter of profit, and this past quarter that rolled over to about $150 million. And so I'm wondering if there's a difference between the timing on pricing versus cost that explains the rollover in profit. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think we'll look more at it for you, Eric, but I would tell you, typically fourth quarter is the heavy fairly promotional season, so you're going to see a typical investment in those major recipe promotions. Also keep in mind we did have the string cheese recall that hit us top and bottom line. We see it coming back beautifully now, but that could explain some of the difference. But I'll let Doug follow-up with a look. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [38]

All right. I'll pass it on. Thanks.

Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just a couple questions. First, just going back to bridging, trying to bridge free cash flow from 2013 to 2014, just want to make sure I heard correctly. On the pension contribution, is next year's, is 2014's contribution expected to be $200 million? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terry List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's what we currently estimate, yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And the contribution you made in 2013 was $600 million? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terry List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Correct. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then appreciate the comment about the tax payment. But if we're starting point is $1.5 billion, and assuming that is a good starting point now as we bridge to 2014, is that right or is there anything unusual in the $1.5 billion? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terry List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think the only thing that's unusual is the very strong year. In particularly in the fourth quarter we ended up for a variety of reasons with our inventory levels a bit lower; we had weather, we had the cheese recall, there were some things that brought that down lower than we expected. Now, that just makes it more of a challenge for us to make that same progress next year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. But we should see at least a $400 million favorable swing on the pension contribution? Again, building off the $1.5 billion, and then the question is just going to be what happens with working capital? Am I thinking about that right? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terry List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In cap spending, but yes, pretty much. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And I didn't hear, have you given a view on cap spending for 2014? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terry List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We haven't. We said it'd be about in the range of 3%. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then just one last question. Tony, there's been a lot of -- a lot written and a lot said about K-Cups recently. And Green Mountain is now being sued. There's a lot of fisticuffs in the trade about regarding exclusivity, and so could you just talk a little bit about your observations from where you sit, what you've seen, and if there's any tactical adjustments you may make? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [51]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First incredible K-Cups. So no, this is a category I love, one of those way in the back categories, but only mid teens penetration when we know all those European and Canadian countries are at 30. So there's no surprise that a lot of people care about this with deep emotion. 
I think consumers are going to vote with their wallets. I like where we are. I like being able to control my destiny. I think there's a lot of stuff going on. 
We're following it as closely as you. It's breaking every moment. And we love where we are and we're especially excited about our four-market test of the McDonald's partnership that includes roast and ground and hopefully a future in all coffee cup vehicles. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [54]

Just one more quick follow-up on cheese prices. Clearly people are searching for how much friction you're talking about. Perhaps this evening or next week, you could point us to maybe an analogous period about how quickly the profit might build back up in that category. So I'll just throw that one out there. 
Separately, just talking big picture about the supermarket these days, it appears that produce, meats, and dairy are outpacing the center of the store. Kraft compared to a lot of the conventional food companies, has a pretty good exposure to some of these categories. Are you seeing this? And are you thinking about how you can play into this more in 2014 than perhaps we've seen to date? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protein is hot, David. Moms have figured out, especially all those strapped moms that this is a great way to feed their kids with the right level of nutrition. And protein, whether it's peanuts or meets or cheese, which happened -- we happen to be the leaders in each of those categories -- we feel great about what we can do there. 
I hope you'll notice and you'll hear my trumpeting this at CAGNY, we're introducing a product called P3, which combines all of those products into a convenient snacking unit that we think is going to be a big winner. So yes, the answer to your question is an emphatic yes.

So just say big picture, what changes the trajectory of the sales growth below population growth to above population growth? And what are the categories that will lead that acceleration? Sounds like back half of the year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I look forward to talking this to you at CAGNY, and Chris is telling me not to bury my headlines for that. We believe there are lots of opportunities to innovate and better serve today's consumers. And at the end of my talk today, you heard me talk about growing: growing consumer cohorts. And we don't think we have our fair share of that growth today. And we think we will in the future. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Zaslow,  Bank of Montreal - Analyst    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. Let me turn to the other side. Where do you still see the greatest opportunity for margin on your cost savings? Obviously the cheese, it sounds like you've wrung out as much as you can there and you're trying that price through. But what are the other divisions that you expect to see some incremental change in margin structure over 9, 12, 18 months that you guys are really focusing on now? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Remember it's about margin dollars, not margin percent. But I expect you and Bob Gorski is even more eloquent than I. 
Recall that I said we're in the third inning of a nine inning game. And he corrected me in back-to-school and said he doesn't understand why with positive lifetime annuity brands and volume growth you can't continue to deliver cost savings and margin dollar improvement for many, many years to come. 
We're at four Sigma on, I think, 20% some of our lines. And we've got a lot of opportunity there. So no, we see -- by the way you mentioned cheese. I don't see cheese as done with cost improvement. I wouldn't want George Zoghbi, my cheese leader who's listening to think he's done. So lots more to come. I'd go back to Gorski's presentation at back-to-school. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Zaslow,  Bank of Montreal - Analyst    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then my final question is could you talk a second about -- you addressed all the categories that you were fixing except for ready to drink. Can you address that? And then I'll pass it on. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. We talked to you about ready to drink. Capri Sun and we talked to you about volumes being soft in the category. We've had some packaging issues. There are some general consumer trends, as you know in the sugar sweetened, high fructose corn sweetened area that are going against us. 
Looking forward, we've got some great packaging improvements to highlight Capri Sun's unique point of difference, which is no preservatives. We've also got some work going on with some news to come on new more popular sweeteners with moms. Those are the two key areas you'll see changes in.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(laughter). Very funny, Rob. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rob Moskow,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's the end of the day. Okay. 
So I was wondering, I know you don't have annual guidance for us, but when you're giving targets to your business managers, you must have annual targets. So is it fair to say that those targets are pretty much in line with your annual -- with your long-term type of goals as well? There's nothing unusual about 2014 in that regard internally in your targets? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keep in mind, it's all about revenue-driven profit growth. And they've got three different targets. I think this is in the Ks, and it's top line, it's OI, and it's cash flow. So I will tell you in general it's different by category, in a lot of categories, but in general the business units have a target that is to grow faster than their market and key competitor. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rob Moskow,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. That's as close as I'm going to get there. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You complimented us on this in your insightful 82-page note. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rob Moskow,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I did. I did. 
And lastly, after complimenting you on that note then I came down pretty hard on the third quarter, so I was citing some businesses that seem to be where the declines were accelerating. It seemed like -- I called them sick businesses. 
Now you're saying that Jell-O there's some signs of life there, there's some signs of life in salad dressing. Have those declines when you look at those sick businesses, have they gotten less bad? And do you feel like you're bottoming out when you look at those? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I thought you did have an insightful note on this. So 11 of 17 categories, the same ones you measure in Nielsen are growing faster than their market and key competitor. That's 60% of our volume and it's up 25 points from a year ago. However, in the 6 that you talk about, we're down to a degree that we basically over wash those 11. 
Category by category, I pointed them out. I want to be transparent about it. We just talked about Capri Sun. Cold cuts I've made into a poster boy for detail. 
I feel good about the progress we're making. And I'm going to continue to talk about those and focus you on them, because at the end of the day, that will determine the turnaround. And in those categories we've got some really important brands from Jell-O to Capri Sun. It's challenging but we like our chances. 
You even pointed this out, who would have thought cheese would be the star category in food and beverage? And if we can turn around cheese, can we turnaround Jell-O? You bet.

Rob Moskow,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [78]

David Driscoll,  Citigroup - Analyst    [80]

Terry, can you just reconcile a couple of numbers on the fourth quarter? Did lower restructuring costs benefit the quarter by I think $0.06 and maybe lower tax by $0.01? Are those numbers about right? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terry List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We'll get back to you on the specifics. The restructuring sounds about right. Tax probably about right, maybe just a bit more. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Driscoll,  Citigroup - Analyst    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe just a bit more? Okay. And then EPS, so you don't want to give a target each year but you give this page that says a mid-to high single digits. So that's a $0.04 to $0.09 range, but then you're specific about a soft first quarter. And you call out a number of explicit challenges. 
Are we supposed to read the tarot cards, the fortune cookie whatever it is that you like the best that this is at the lower end of the range? Is that the telegraph by these comments on first quarter? Or is it the comments on first quarter are just specific to Q1, and don't try to take that to the full year? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terry List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(laughter) So I'll start with we're not going to give real details on the guidance we provided by line item or by (inaudible -- technical difficulties) period. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Driscoll,  Citigroup - Analyst    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's clear. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terry List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Call out a few of those things. The way to think about it is front half back half we should be fairly consistent with the long-term objectives that we've laid out. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Driscoll,  Citigroup - Analyst    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then final comment is just simply ConAgra made some pretty important comments about pricing pressures on branded foods. Can you give us your take on it? A massive portfolio, you certainly are in these conversations with the retailers daily. Do you see the pressures from the retailers as something significantly different today than maybe what we've seen in prior years? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Honestly, I don't, David. I think it's a strapped consumer that's the more important dynamic than it is commodities or those things. It's not surprising that our retailers are really pushing value and doing a lot of price matching. 
But we and the rest of the industry need to continue providing a playbook that addresses consumer needs. Private-label's not growing. So it's a question of giving the consumers what they need whether they are a Millennial, they're Hispanic, they're a strapped mom, or they're looking for health and wellness options. 
And I feel as I said pretty good about our pricing power because we are in the midst of this regeneration rejuvenation of our brands with innovation and equity. But hey, good, better, best has been the key to the success we've had in those categories that we're doing well. And it really does address what the retailers are looking for.

Tony, I also wanted to ask you about your comment that volumes are growing slower than population and it has been going on for a while. Do you have any updated thoughts for us where the calories are really coming from these days? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's a great question. I thought there were some good notes written on this. The food budget is the one area that in the short term a family can manage. They can't manage their electricity, their mortgage, their gas. Those things they've got to have if they want to get to work, keep their house, and pay their mortgage. You do see food getting hit and being pushed. 
I look forward to doing this at CAGNY in pretty great detail because I think that's the place we're really going to get into some of these behaviors and how we think we're uniquely positioned to show you there's some growth in some key cohorts. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thilo Wrede,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [93]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Then let me ask -- I don't want to steal your CAGNY Summit, so I fully understand, but let me ask you a related question. Given these weak volumes, how often do you have to call your brand managers or maybe how many -- how often do your business heads have to call the brand managers into the office to make sure that they really hold the line on pricing? And that pricing isn't used by the brand managers to drive volumes? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [94]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've been very disciplined on PNOC. We look at it on a two-year stack and we're ahead. I'm proud of it. And I think that that call is sort of the foundation of how we reinvest in our brands. 
You've seen that we haven't fallen into the promotional game as the only one that -- I think the only one that grew double-digit advertising and they're telling me it's more than double digits, it's mid teens. We're going to continue to reinvest in the equity of our brands and not fall into that promotional track.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unbelievable, right? Nothing to do but settle down and eat some good Kraft Foods. So a couple detail questions. 
Maybe if I could get at the cost savings question a little different way, just to get us in the ballpark, can you talk about the kind of hurdle rates you use when you think about internal, the restructuring program? What's the hurdle rate for above this, we do the project, below this, we don't do the project? If you just get us in the ballpark, I'd appreciate it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [100]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not sure we want to give this away, Jonathan. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terry List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [101]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And it's not as simple as just the math, right? A lot of times obviously we have very disciplined hurdle rates as we look at projects, but a lot of times there's strategic value. There's long-term benefits, so it's a pretty robust process as we think through what are all the choices we have with limited funds and how do we want to prioritize those, et cetera? But clearly we're looking at a risk-adjusted ROI as a big factor in making that determination. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Feeney,  Janney Capital Markets - Analyst    [102]

Okay. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [103]

Jonathan, in five out of three quarters, my hurdle rate is lower than Terry's at 6.1. (laughter). 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Feeney,  Janney Capital Markets - Analyst    [104]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good to know. Okay. I'll factor that into my analysis. I guess one other bigger picture question. When I looked at your categories I was a little struck by you look at the snacks business where some peanut prices have come down a little bit. You didn't really -- categories where you've had the price, and volumes didn't really get hit too badly. Categories where prices have come down, it didn't really grow the category as much. 
We have heard a lot a couple years ago about that shopper who's got $100 in his or her pocket, and they walk in and they have to just buy less of stuff because they only have $100 to spend. Are we seeing less of that maybe and maybe less, the consumer's a little bit -- they're certainly value focused. It is certainly super competitive, but maybe a little bit less inspired by discounting and promotions than they were before? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [105]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I hope you're seeing it on Kraft brands because I think the power of our brands --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [107]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(laughter) by the way you mentioned Planters (inaudible) 400 too many SKUs at every price point. But the reality is our goal is to offer the right priced Kraft products at the right moment, and in the snack world, that means you're featuring different things at different times of the month. And I think that's why you saw Planters, especially, hold up so well.

Tony, just looking back at the beverages business, and coffee you've seen the futures curve adjust upwards. It seems we need to take cost pricier at some point before the year is over. So given this data of the consumer are you confident you can essentially pass through those costs without seeing more of unusually high elasticity response from here? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [111]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Tough to forecast pricing. I feel pretty good about the portfolio and how it's demonstrated over the last 18 months: resilience at whether price goes up or down. The beauty to me of the Kraft portfolio and the reason we are so serious about Keurig compatible cups in Tassimo is that it gives us good, better, best in a beautiful way with the Maxwell House, then Gevalia, and then K-Cups, and Tassimo compatible K-Cups. Now we add McDonalds to that mix, we have even more price offerings. So, for me I think is the best way to deal with the switching consumer who is trading up or down depending on their need in the coffee category. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Baumgartner,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [112]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And just as a follow-up in terms of the Mio cannibalization of powdered beverages, what's your thoughts on that in 2014? To get to a stabilization at some point or volume decline, or just keep slow grind downwards from here? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [113]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, it's a tale of two cities. Mio is growing by leaps and bounds still. We did take our eye off the ball. And Dino Bianco who heads up beverages would be the first person to tell you, in all the Mio excitement and we introduced the big Kool-Aid and Crystal Light line extension, with Crystal Light powder took a backseat. 
Now the good news is that Mio is accretive on the margin dollar and percent then, so cannibalizing ourselves we go up. But the reality is we got to make sure that that big multi-$100 million Crystal Light business maintains its relevance, and you'll see a lot of things coming on that in the powder area.

I just have a question for you just looking back at your long-term growth algorithm that you gave us back during the split, operating income growth of mid-single digits and EPS mid-to high-single digits, which obviously would show that there's some leverage below the operating line that you've included when you gave us this target. 
I guess my question is, you announced in December a fairly substantial share repo program. And I understand you may not do it all tomorrow, but presuming that you do that over some reasonable period of time, to what extent would that change this growth algorithm or was that included when you gave the original guidance back in September of 2012?

Terry List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [117]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That was basically anticipated. We have some option solution that we knew we would have some share repurchase, but we also saw the potential for the cash build up that would give us that flexibility going forward. So that's not incremental to the long-term guidance that we had had in place.

Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [118]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diane, when you think about it as we model it out, our expected performance going forward, there was always an assumption for use of free cash flow. Right? 
But we didn't really earmark it then. We're not earmarking it now. But obviously with the free cash flow that you generate, between servicing the dividend and reinvesting back in the business or doing share repurchases, you would expect some performance from those investments. So that's how you got to a little bit of leverage between OI and EPS.

Thanks for the final question here. Tony, this might be a CAGNY issue as well, but I just wanted to revisit your cautious commentary on the SNAP program cuts, and the fact that you put it in writing included in the presentation. I just want to attach some importance to it. But I just wanted to see if there's any anecdotal commentary you can give us as far as specific categories within your business or areas of the store that you see being impacted? Whether you're observing lower volumes, lower traffic, trade down, anything to contextualize it? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [122]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I sure will. I -- first, on SNAP, and I get quoted a lot -- Kraft feeds America's families. And it's got to be all America's families. The unfortunate reality for all of us is that hunger is a very real problem. With so many people facing the challenges, we believe SNAP can be an important tool and this is the industry's position in the fight against hunger providing real assistance to those struggling Americans. 
We've done a good job. And I'm going to talk at CAGNY about where I think we're underdeveloped or developed. We've done a good job making sure that we work to feed America's families and we do it through good, better, best pricing, and ensuring our brands are accessible in all the channels we shop. And there's been some good research written by you guys about channels that should be bigger in and we're going to talk about that at CAGNY. 
In terms of volume, I've seen you guys report on how much volume it is of ours or somebody else's. I don't think you're that far off, but it's not an exact science. We don't report against the data. I don't think the data's that clean. I think SNAP consumers are an important group for us to serve. And we've got to do it with all the pieces of our portfolio that we can. 
I don't believe -- I think somebody wrote that it's pushing on a string to pursue them and I don't believe that, because we have plants that have 30% capacity now because of lean Six Sigma and we have ways that we can package with margins that are putting money in the bank to make sure we're serving these American families.
