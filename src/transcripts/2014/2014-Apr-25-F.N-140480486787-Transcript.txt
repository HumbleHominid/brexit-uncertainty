Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Ford first-quarter earnings conference call. My name is Tawanda and I will be your coordinator for today. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. George Sharp, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George Sharp,  Ford Motor Company - Executive Director, IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Tawanda and good morning. Welcome to everyone joining us today either by phone or by webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning so we can provide you with additional details of our first-quarter 2014 financial results.
Presenting today are Alan Mulally, President and CEO of Ford and Bob Shanks, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Mark Fields, Chief Operating Officer; Stuart Rowley, Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO.
Copies of this morning's press release and presentation slides are available on Ford's investor and media website. Please note that the financial results discussed today are preliminary and include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q and any non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the US GAAP equivalent in the appendix of the slide deck.
Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Of course, actual results could be different. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation and detailed in our SEC filings. With that, I'd now like to turn the presentation over to Alan.

          Thank you, George and good morning to everyone. We are pleased to have the opportunity today to review our first-quarter 2014 business performance as we continue to move forward with the implementation of our ONE Ford plan. Let's get started and turn to the first slide please.
Our ONE Ford plan shown here continues to guide everything that we do. We continue to aggressively restructure the business to operate profitably at the current demand and the changing model mix, accelerate development of the new products our customers want and value, finance our plan and improve our balance sheet and work together effectively as one team leveraging our global assets. Our commitment remains to serve customers in all markets with a full family of best-in-class vehicles -- small, medium and large; cars, utilities and trucks -- delivering profitable growth for all.
Now let's turn to slide 2 and review a summary of our first-quarter accomplishments. The Company achieved its 19th consecutive profitable quarter in the first quarter with a positive operating-related cash flow and continued strong liquidity. Once again, the top line grew with wholesale volume up 6% from a year ago and Company revenue improving about 1%. We saw higher marketshare in Asia Pacific where we achieved a record share in China. Among our business units, Asia Pacific reported a record quarterly profit. North America, Middle East & Africa were profitable and Ford Credit once again delivered solid results. Europe reduced its loss substantially compared with last year, but South America incurred a larger loss. This year will feature the most product launches in our history and we remain on track with the 23 global product launches we announced late last year.
Overall, the Company's results were solid, but the quarter was impacted adversely by several significant factors that are not representative of the underlying run rate of our business. Based on our solid start, we continue to expect the Company's full-year pretax profit to range from $7 billion to $8 billion. Our outlook for automotive revenue, operating margin and operating-related cash flow also remains unchanged.
Before turning to the financial details, let's recap some of our other achievements from the first quarter. As shown on slide 3, we revealed several concepts and products in the first quarter, including the all-new 2015 F-150, the Figo and Ka four-door concepts, the new 2015 Focus five door and wagon and the new 2015 Expedition and Lincoln Navigator. We accelerated the momentum of our our global Transit line with the launch of the two ton Transit in Europe, the Transit Connect in US and Canada and the Transit Custom in Australia. In Asia Pacific, we expanded the production of EcoSport to Thailand making it the fourth plant globally to build the all new urban SUV.
We announced an investment of $168 million at the Ohio assembly plant for production of the all-new 2016 F-650 and F-750 medium duty trucks beginning in spring of 2015. Also in the US, we announced an investment of $580 million and an additional 650 jobs to build a new 2.7 liter EcoBoost engine at Lima engine plant in Ohio to increase production of Super Duty at Kentucky Truck. We also announced new automated driving research projects with MIT and Stanford University, as well as expansion of our research and engineering center in Nanjing, China. And finally, in January, we increased our quarterly dividend by 25%, the second increase since restoring the dividend in January of 2012. Now, Bob Shanks will take you through the detail of our first-quarter financial results. Bob?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Alan and good morning, everyone. Starting at the top on slide 4, first-quarter wholesale volume was 1.6 million units, up 92,000 units from a year ago and revenue was $35.9 billion, up $300 million. Pretax profit was $1.4 billion, excluding special items, $765 million lower than a year ago. After-tax earnings per share at $0.25 were $0.16 lower. Net income attributable to Ford, including pretax special item charges of $122 million, was $989 million, which was $622 million lower than a year ago. Earnings were $0.24 a share, down $0.16. The pretax special item charges of $122 million are for separation-related actions, primarily in Europe to support our transformation plan. You can find additional detail in Appendix 3.
Automotive operating-related cash flow was $1.2 billion, our 16th consecutive quarter of positive performance. And automotive gross cash was $25.2 billion, exceeding debt by $9.5 billion. Our first-quarter operating effective tax rate, which isn't shown, was 38%. Consistent with prior guidance, we expect our full-year operating effective tax rate to be about 35%.
As shown on slide 5, both of our sectors, automotive and financial services, contributed to the Company's first-quarter pretax profit. As shown in the memo, the year-over-year decline in Company first-quarter pretax profit is explained primarily by the automotive sector. Within automotive, lower results in North and South America were offset partially by an improvement of nearly $600 million from the other automotive regions. Compared with fourth quarter 2013, Company pretax profit was $63 million higher, more than explained by financial services.
The key market factors and financial metrics for our automotive business in the first quarter are shown on slide 6. Beginning this quarter, we will report global and total regional industry SAAR and marketshare data to improve transparency and reflect the markets covered by each of our automotive business units. As you can see on the far left and as already mentioned, wholesale volume increased by 6% compared with a year ago. Automotive revenue on the other hand was unchanged. The higher volume is more than explained by higher industry volumes in all regions except South America, improved marketshare in Asia Pacific and the favorable change in dealer stocks. Global industry SAAR is estimated at 86.5 million units, up over 3% from a year ago. Ford global marketshare is estimated at 6.9%, unchanged from a year ago. Operating margin was 3.4%, down 1.8 percentage points from a year ago and automotive pretax profit was $919 million, down $724 million. Lower results in North and South America more than explain the change in both metrics.
As mentioned, the first-quarter results include several significant adverse factors that we do not consider to be representative of the underlying run rate of our business. They are shown here on slide 7. In North America, these factors total about $500 million. They include a $400 million increase in warranty reserves for field service actions, which include safety recalls and other product campaigns related to 2008 through 2013 models, as well as expense for 2001 through 2005 model vehicles.
We also experienced premium freight and labor costs of about $100 million during the quarter related to the harsh winter weather in the US, which disrupted our operations as well as those of many of our suppliers. In South America, we saw significant currency devaluations across our major markets during the quarter. These are shown in Appendix 12. In addition to the operating effect of these exchange rate movements, we've recorded charges of about $400 million related to the one-time balance sheet impact of these changes. Included is $310 million related to the Venezuelan Bolivar. In total, these factors reduced pretax profit by about $900 million or the equivalent of $0.17 per share. They also account for a year-over-year decline in Company pretax profit of $700 million as shown in the memo. While similar factors could occur in the future, it is unusual for items like these to occur in this magnitude in the same quarter. Isolating these factors provides a better understanding of what we believe to be the underlying run rate of the Company and our North and South America business units.
Slide 8 shows the factors that contributed to the $724 million decline in automotive first-quarter pretax profit, including the items just reviewed on the prior slide. The year-over-year decline in automotive pretax profit can be explained fully by the warranty and premium weather-related costs in North America and the balance sheet exchange effects in South America. All other factors effectively offset one another.
Slide 9 shows the first-quarter pretax results for each of our automotive operations, as well as other automotive. Effective with this quarter, we are reporting results for Middle East & Africa, our new business unit that was formed to facilitate an increase focus on this important growth region. To allow comparison, we have revised prior-year financials and physicals for each of our other business units to align with this new reporting structure. Total automotive sector bottom-line reporting, of course, is not impacted by this change. You can find detail on the revisions in Appendices 14 through 16.
As you can see, North America reported a solid first-quarter result notwithstanding the factors discussed earlier while Asia Pacific's profit was a record for any quarter. Europe cut its loss by more than half from year ago and by nearly two-thirds from fourth quarter 2013. The automotive operations outside North America improved $265 million from a year ago notwithstanding the larger loss in South America mainly due to the factors discussed earlier. The change in other automotive from a year ago was more than explained by an unfavorable fair value adjustment of our investment in Mazda. For the full year, we now expect net interest expense to be about $700 million, a $100 million improvement from our prior guidance reflecting higher interest income.
Now I'll look at each of the regions within the automotive sector starting on slide 10 with North America. North America's first-quarter pretax profit continued to be driven by robust industry sales, our strong product lineup, continued discipline in matching production to demand and a lean cost structure even as we continue to invest for future growth. North America wholesale volume and revenue declined 2% and 5% respectively in the first quarter. The volume decrease is more than explained by lower marketshare. This was offset in part by higher industry sales, including a US SAAR of 16 million units that was 400,000 units higher than a year ago and a favorable change in dealer stocks.
The decline in revenue mainly reflects the lower wholesale volume, as well as unfavorable mix, lower net pricing and the adverse effect of a weaker Canadian dollar. North America operating margin was 7.3%, down 3.8 percentage points from last year and pretax profit was $1.5 billion, about $900 million lower than last year's record profit. The adverse impact of $500 million associated with the warranty reserve and weather-related premium cost, as noted earlier, is worth 2.5 percentage points of operating margin.
On slide 11, we show the factors that contributed to North America's first-quarter decline in pretax profit from last year. The deterioration is more than explained by unfavorable market factors and higher cost. The unfavorable volume and mix is explained primarily by planned reductions and daily rental sales and lower small car share, as well as unfavorable series mix and option take rates ahead of the launch of our new products. Net pricing is lower mainly due to Fusion and Escape, which had very low levels of incentives a year ago due to the launch of these models. The higher costs are more than explained by the unfavorable $500 million related to the factors previously discussed. As shown in the memo, pretax profit was lower than in fourth quarter 2013, more than explained by unfavorable market factors, including higher incentive spending, unfavorable product mix and lower industry volume.
Ford's US marketshare trends are shown on slide 12. Starting with the left chart, our total US marketshare was 15.3% in the first quarter, down 6/10 of a percentage point from a year ago, reflecting planned reductions in daily rental sales and lower small car retail share. Total F-Series share was unchanged from a year ago. Compared with the fourth quarter, our marketshare was down 1/10 of a percentage point.
As shown in the right chart, our retail marketshare of the retail industry was 13.5% in the first quarter, down 5/10 of a percentage point from last year explained primarily by lower small car segmentation and share performance, as well as F-Series. F-Series results reflect our disciplined approach to incentive spending as we manage inventory ahead of the launch of the new F-150. Compared with the fourth quarter, our retail marketshare was down 2/10 of a percentage point with losses on F-Series offset partially by Fusion and Escape. F-Series results reflect our disciplined incentive strategy, as well as seasonal full-size pickup segmentation trends. Turning to our full-year guidance for North America, we continue to expect pretax profit to be lower than last year and operating margin to range from 8% to 9%.
Now let's turn to slide 13 and review South America where we are continuing to execute our strategy of expanding our product lineup and progressively replacing legacy products with global ONE Ford offerings. Now, however, we are also dealing with slower GDP growth in our larger markets, weaker currencies, high inflation, along with political and social turmoil in some countries. In the first quarter, wholesale volume and revenue decreased from a year ago by 8% and 18% respectively. The lower volume is more than explained by a 200,000 unit decline from last year's SAAR of 5.9 million units. This includes the impact of import restrictions in Argentina and lower production in Venezuela resulting from limited availability of US dollars. The revenue decline is explained primarily by unfavorable exchange and unfavorable volume and mix offset partially by higher net pricing. Operating margin was negative 27%, down significantly and pretax loss was $510 million, a deterioration of $292 million. The balance sheet exchange effects discussed earlier account for about 75% of the quarterly loss.
On slide 14, we show the factors causing a decline in South America's first-quarter pretax results from a year ago. The decline is explained by unfavorable exchange, higher cost mainly associated with economics-related effects caused by high local inflation and lower volume mainly due to the weaker industry. Although net pricing was substantial, including some pricing associated with new products, it was not enough to offset the currency and inflation-related effects. As shown in the memo, pretax results deteriorated compared with fourth quarter of 2013 more than explained by unfavorable exchange. For the full year, we now expect South America to incur a larger loss than in 2013. Based on our present assumptions, we expect the rest of the year to be about breakeven to a small loss.
Let's turn now to Europe beginning on slide 15 where we continue to implement our transformation plan and remain on track to achieve profitability in 2015. Europe's wholesale volume and revenue improved from a year ago, up 11% and 18% respectively. The volume increases more than explained by higher industry volumes reflecting a SAAR of 14.5 million units for the Europe 20 market, up over 1 million units, as well as favorable changes in dealer stocks and higher marketshare for Europe 20. The increase in revenue mainly reflects the higher volume and favorable exchange. Europe's operating margin was a negative 2.5%, an improvement of 4 percentage points from a year ago and the pretax loss was $194 million, a $231 million improvement. The first-quarter loss includes $76 million of restructuring costs.
Slide 16 shows the factors that contributed to the improvement in Europe's first-quarter pretax results from a year ago. The improvement reflects lower cost, favorable market factors and favorable exchange. This was offset partially by lower joint venture results and royalties in Russia and Turkey included in other. As shown in the memo below the chart, pretax results improved compared with fourth quarter 2013 with both factors favorable.
Our European marketshare trends are shown on slide 17. Starting with the left chart, our total first-quarter marketshare for Europe 20 was 8%, up 3/10 of a percentage point from a year ago reflecting improved share from Mondeo and Kuga. Although not shown on the chart, our commercial vehicle share also improved in the first quarter driven by the new Transit Connect as we continue to roll out our all new commercial vehicle range.
As shown on the right chart, or passenger car share of the retail segment of the five major European markets was 8.3% in the first quarter, down 1/10 of a percentage point from the same period last year. Lower share reflects adverse segmentation changes offset partially by improved performance for Fiesta and Kuga. We continue to focus on the quality of our marketshare and improving our sales channel mix achieving a higher share of the fleet segment in the first quarter.
We are very pleased with the start to the year by our operations in Europe and the progress the team continues to make in implementing our transformation plan notwithstanding external headwinds in Russia and Turkey. As a result, our full-year guidance for Europe is unchanged. We expect results to improve compared with 2013.
Let's now turn to Middle East & Africa on slide 18. In the first quarter, we wholesaled 51,000 vehicles in the region, 3,000 fewer units than a year ago. Revenue was $1.2 billion, $100 million lower. The lower volume reflects lower dealer stock increases. The lower revenue was more than explained by the lower volume and unfavorable exchange primarily due to a weaker South African rand. Operating margin was 4.7%, up 1 percentage point from a year ago and pretax profit was $54 million, up $7 million. Our full-year guidance for Middle East & Africa remains unchanged. We expect results to be about breakeven.
Let's now review Asia Pacific on slide 19. Our strategy in Asia Pacific continues to be to grow aggressively with an expanding portfolio of ONE Ford products with manufacturing hubs in China, India and ASEAN. As shown on the left, first-quarter wholesale volume was up 32% and net revenue, which excludes our China joint ventures, grew 19%. Our China wholesale volume not shown was up 45% in the quarter. The higher volume in the region reflects mainly improved marketshare. The higher industry volume also contributed. We estimate the first-quarter SAAR for the region at 38.9 million units, up 1.9 million units from a year ago wholly explained by China.
Our first-quarter marketshare was 3.4%, 7/10 of a percentage point higher than a year ago. This was driven by China where our marketshare improved 9/10 of a percentage point to a record 4.5% reflecting continued strong sales of EcoSport, Kuga and Mondeo. Asia Pacific's higher revenue is more than explained by favorable mix and the higher volume. Operating margin was 11.1%, up 12.4 percentage points from a year ago and pretax profit was $291 million, up $319 million. Strong results in China drove the region's record profit.
The improvement in Asia Pacific's first-quarter pretax profit from a year ago is explained on slide 20. For the region, the improvement in profitability is more than explained by favorable volume and mix and the higher royalties from our joint ventures included in other. Higher costs, including investment for future growth, were a partial offset. As shown in the memo, Asia Pacific pretax results improved from fourth quarter 2013 explained primarily by lower cost. For the full year, we now expect Asia Pacific to earn a higher pretax profit than a year ago improved from our prior guidance of about even.
Let's turn now to Ford Credit, which remains key to our global growth strategy, providing world-class dealer and customer financial services, maintaining a strong balance sheet and producing solid profits and distributions. Slide 21 shows the factors that contributed to the largely unchanged result from a year ago. Higher volume reflecting increases in nearly all products globally was largely offset by unfavorable residual performance in North America. As shown in the memo, pretax profit was higher than in fourth quarter 2013 explained primarily by favorable lease residual performance, as well as lower operating costs included in other. These changes are consistent with normal seasonality. For the full year, we now expect Ford Credit pretax profit to be about equal to higher than 2013. This reflects improved financing margin performance. Our guidance for Ford Credit managed receivables, managed leverage and distributions to its parent is unchanged.
Next on slide 22 is our automotive gross cash and operating-related cash flow. Automotive gross cash at the end of the quarter was $25.2 billion, $400 million higher than year-end 2013. Automotive operating-related cash flow was $1.2 billion with favorable changes in working capital and automotive profit offset partially by unfavorable timing and other differences, as well as net spending. During the quarter, we contributed $500 million to our global funded pension plans, down substantially from the last two years due to the recent improvements in the funded status of our plans. Dividends paid in the quarter totaled about $500 million.
Slide 23 shows that automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $15.7 billion, unchanged from year-end 2013. We ended the quarter with net cash of $9.5 billion and automotive liquidity of $36.6 billion, both $400 million higher than year-end 2013. Although not yet included in our total liquidity, we are in process of amending and extending our corporate revolving credit facility. The facility, which is presently $10.7 billion, is expected to grow to about $12 billion. This will provide the Company with additional liquidity as we expand our business globally and continues to show the great support we have from our global and growing bank group for the ONE Ford plan. Consistent with our capital and funding strategy, we plan to allocate $2 billion to Ford Credit to support its liquidity. We expect to close this transaction later this month and will provide details in our first-quarter 10-Q filing.
This concludes our review of the financial details of our first-quarter earnings. So with that, I'd now like to turn it back to Alan who will take us through our outlook for the business environment, as well as our 2014 planning assumptions and key metrics. Alan?

          Thank you, Bob. Slide 24 summarizes our view of the business environment for 2014. We project global economic growth to be in the 2.5% to 3% range and global industry sales to be about 85 million to 90 million units. US economic growth is projected to be in the 2.5% to 3% range with industry sales still supported by replacement demand as a result of the older age of vehicles on the road. Near-term conditions have shown signs of improvement after some weakness in January and February data. In South America, Brazil's economy is slowing due to high interest rates put in place to contain inflation while the situation in Argentina and Venezuela remains volatile with both economies facing unclear economic policy direction.
In Europe, an economic recovery is underway. For 2014, we expect GDP growth of about 1% in the euro area and 2% to 2.5% in the UK. The European Central Bank left its policy interest rate unchanged at 0.25% in April and indicated that it will keep rates low for an extended period. The Bank of England also indicated it will keep rates low until economic growth reduces excess capacity in the UK economy. And in Asia Pacific, China's economic growth is expected to be slightly below 7.5% with several challenges, including excess capacity and excess debt. The government intends to be more focused on structural reforms and is willing to accept lower growth within a reasonable range of 7.5%. Growth in India is expected to improve modestly to about 5% from last year as high inflation and high interest rates remain impediments to stronger growth. Overall, despite challenges in the emerging markets, we expect global economic growth to continue in 2014.
Slide 25 recaps the guidance disclosed earlier for all of our business units, as well as for net interest expense. Other than South America, the guidance is improved or unchanged.
Our Company guidance for 2014 is detailed on slide 26. We continue to expect full-year industry volume to range from 16 million to 17 million units in the US and China to range from 22.5 million to 24.5 million units. We now expect Europe 20 markets to be in the 14 million to 15 million unit range reflecting improved economic growth prospects and replacement demand. In terms of our financial performance, we continue to expect automotive revenue to be about equal to 2013, automotive operating margin to be lower than 2013 and automotive operating-related cash flow to be substantially lower than 2013. This includes capital spending of about $7.5 billion to support new or significantly refreshed products and capacity actions. We now expect Ford Credit pretax profit to be about equal to or higher than 2013 and we continue to expect Company pretax profit to be in the $7 billion to $8 billion range as we continue to create innovative products such as the all-new F-150. Overall, we expect 2014 to be a solid year for the Ford Motor Company and a critical next step forward in implementing our ONE Ford plan to continue delivering profitable growth for all.
In closing, our ONE Ford plan is built on a compelling vision, comprehensive strategy and relentless implementation. Our ONE Ford plan continues to deliver profitable growth around the world and we are absolutely focused on building great products, creating a stronger business and contributing to a better world. We delivered solid results in the first quarter despite several significant adverse factors that are not representative of the underlying run rate of our business and challenges in several important emerging markets. We remain on track in implementing our plan for full-year 2014, including continued strength from North America, although down from recent years, as we launch three times the number of products as in 2013, a loss in South America as we adjust to the changing environment and continued risks in Argentina and Venezuela, successful execution of our transformational plan for Europe as we progress towards profitability in 2015 notwithstanding new challenges in Russia and Turkey, launch of our Middle East & Africa business unit, continued strong growth and profitability in Asia Pacific, consistent solid performance from our Ford Credit operation and positive automotive operating-related cash flow. Now we would be pleased to take your questions. George?

          Thanks, Alan. Now we will open up the lines for about a 45-minute Q&A session. We will begin with questions from the investment community and then take questions from the media. Now in order to allow for as many participants as possible within this timeframe, please keep your questions brief and please avoid asking more than two. Tawanda, can we have the first question?

Questions and Answers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adam Jonas,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hey, good morning, everybody. Two brief questions. First, on the Asia Pacific margin, 11.1%, pretty astonishing result. I think that is about at least three times maybe the margin that the market expected. Can I give you a chance right now to kind of say hold your horses, folks; please don't extrapolate this; consider the following headwinds that should keep us lower than that? That is my first question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, so I will say hold some of your horses. We have improved our guidance so we do expect the region to contribute more positively than we did three months ago because the performance is strong and it is being driven by China and the great response that consumers are giving our products and our brands. So it is going to do better. I would not multiply it times four, which I think is the gist of the question, Adam. And that is largely around the fact that we still have these six plants under construction. Some of them will be coming onstream later this year. I think two other ones come onstream in 2015. So as we get closer to launch of those facilities, the cost will increase. We bring people on board, we start to train them before we start producing, that type of thing.
The other factor is we have got Lincoln launching later this year. Of course, as we -- we are already incurring expense related to that, but as we get closer to the launch in the latter part of the year, there will be more expense associated with that. So I think those are the caveats I would put on, but clearly the region is doing fabulously and we think it is going to have a great, great year.
And finally, what we have been talking about and it has been kind of eeking through a bit more quarter by quarter, you are starting to see the payoff of the big investments in the region.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adam Jonas,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, it is really moving the needle now. All right, second question on the F-Series changeover, another chance for you to take this opportunity to tell us anything in the remaining quarters of the year outlook, particularly in the second half for your -- aside from the 13-weeks downtime and the cadence there you have already talked about -- that you might say, please, guys, this is complicated, big, big change for us, add a little more -- any chance we'd add any more caution in that second-half outlook in North America for us or not? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, let me give a couple comments first broadly and then Mark can comment further on F-Series. So one thing I would say, first at the Company level, we had a solid start for the year and I am sure we are going to get questions throughout the call on the slide 7 and the factors that we showed as being sort of standouts, if you will, in terms of the size and the fact that they are all sort of occurring in the quarter. But we see the run rate of the business as being very healthy and very strong both in case of total Company. North America, I'd even say in South America and you heard my comments about the balance of the year, clearly the first quarter is not indicative of what we expect in the balance of the year there. So the run rate of the business is much healthier than what the initial view of the bottom line would see. In fact, if anything, when you think about the emerging market issues, which are more intense than what we expected three months ago, we are absorbing that and still think the business is going to deliver what we expected and in fact, we are now starting to see elements of the business where we are changing the guidance upward. So I just want to give you that sense of how we are kind of seeing the overall business.
In terms of calendarization of profits for the balance of the year, what I will say is that we expect the rest of the quarters to be substantially stronger than what we are seeing in the first quarter and of course, things will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, but they should all be better than what we are seeing in the first quarter. And so, Mark, do you want to comment on F-Series?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. Overall, Adam, the preparations for the launch are going well and the team is very energized; they are going through obviously a number of the production builds, but it is going on plan. As we mentioned last quarter, we had three weeks of the downtime of the 13 in the first quarter. And remember, we mentioned that inclusive of that 13 was the summer shutdown week so you can deduce what quarter that will be in. But clearly, as we said, we go to manufacturing launch in the fourth quarter, so you can pretty much surmise where a lot of the downtime is going to be as we get the plant ready to go.
But overall when you stand back and look at our F-Series business, even with the existing model, our share is about the same as the full year for last year. We continue to run the plants I think very efficiently. Our transaction prices are actually holding up very well. Actually our -- when you look at our transaction prices for our 2014 model year, they are probably at the top of the segment of the under 8,500. So that business is going well. We are also looking at potential production opportunities for the existing F-Series in the remainder of this year. We have more work to do. That could help us potentially get to the upper half of the margin range that we have for North America, but we have some more work to do on that.

Brian Johnson,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I just want to focus on the China results and kind of two related questions. One, can you give us the outlook for Asia Pacific ex-China and just directionally, is that getting better, about the same or worse? And then secondly within China, how much of your success is from CUVs versus the car lineup? How do you feel about your CUV position competitively? And as you kind of bring these plants on board, how are they going to be split between producing CUVs and cars?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, Brian, I will handle the first one and Mark will address the second one. So as I mentioned in the remarks earlier, the quarter's results were driven by China and I think that is both in terms of the year-over-year results and an absolute. The rest of Asia Pacific is not as strong. It is not necessarily a drag on the business, but it is sort of in a different place I think in terms of where we are in putting in place the big global production hubs that we are working on in India and also in Thailand. So I think we will see them start to contribute in a more positive way a little bit after, if you will, the results that we are seeing now with China. Mark?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, on the second question, when you look at our share performance in China, as Bob mentioned upfront, it was actually -- it was a record for the quarter at 4.5%, which was up a point versus a year ago. When you look at some of the elements driving that, to your point, when you look at the segment, the SUV/CUV segment in China, as an industry, it was up about 28%. Our sales were up almost 300% and the reason for that was all the products that we introduced last year, the EcoSport, we have the Explorer there, the Kuga, so we have a full lineup there. And that has been a really important part of our growth in addition to the car side of the business, which we have done very well with.
And then when you look at the texture of that, a lot of our growth has been in the Tier 3 through 6 cities and that has been supported by our network expansion. When you think of maybe some of the infrastructure around there, it lends itself well to SUVs and CUVs. And actually the type of demographics of the customer that we are getting is very encouraging in addition to the profile of the segmentation. We are getting younger customers than the industry average and interestingly depending upon the model lines, 70% to 90% of the customers that are buying our vehicles, it's either a first-time purchase or in addition to the car in the household. So I think that bodes well for us going forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Johnson,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Interesting. So the CUV almost becomes the plus one car for the mass affluent in China?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, we are also doing well and we continue to do well with our Focus. As we said, our overall sales in the first quarter are up 45%, so we are doing well with Focus. Fusion is doing very well there and the Mondeo is actually doing very well. Mondeo is the Fusion, so both of them. It is a combination of both, but clearly our full family of SUVs and CUVs has really helped turbocharge that.

    Colin Langan, UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Langan,  UBS - Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Great. Thanks for taking my question. One, any color on why the recall cost was so large within the quarter and is it the nature of the repair? Just any color on why it is such a large recall cost, is my first question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I have been waiting for this. Thanks, Colin. I appreciate the question. I really do. Because this is a really important thing that we explain. So let me go into a little bit of detail here. So first of all this is a warranty reserve adjustment and I need to explain how we at Ford account for field service actions. We use something that is called a pattern estimation model. So what that means is that every time that we sell a vehicle, we actually accrue a bit of reserve, if you will, for field service actions that could happen in the future. So nothing specific in terms of a particular issue or problem, but based on history we expect that something could happen. So we reserve for that.
And then what we do as we go forth in time, go forward in time, we then sort of top that reserve up or we might take it down based on what we are seeing to changes in more recent history, if you will. I think we go back to about 2008 right now, so we don't go all the way back, but kind of drop a year every year. And so it is just -- it's all based on history and what's actually happened. So what we've seen, we have seen more recalls at Ford and across the whole industry in the last couple of years or so.
So as that has occurred, what we've had to do is we have had to continue to look at the reserves and adjust them and that is what is happening in this quarter. It is based on a process that is disciplined, written in concrete. There is nothing behind this beyond just the update of the data and letting the data tell us that we need to increase the reserves based on what has happened.
Now, a couple of other things to let you know is if we then have vehicles that are older, for example, than 2008 and something happens, what we do is we actually have the impact of that flow right through to the bottom line because we don't have any reserves in place. Because we only hold them for, as I said, maybe six, seven, eight years. If there is -- also another little tweak on this, if there is an action that exceeds, in the case of North America, $250 million of cost, we will let that go right to the bottom line. So we wouldn't adjust our reserves, if you will, on a go-forward basis for that action. We just let it flow through to the bottom line.
And actually we had an instance of that at one point last year. So this is simply a reserve adjustment. It is accounting. It is not cash. It is not related to any particular problem that we know of or that we are concerned about. It is just an anticipation that something could happen based on what we've seen in terms of patterns of data over the model years that we are talking about.
So based on that and letting our process work, we've increased the reserves in the quarter by about $400 million in total. And most of that is related to what I've talked about in terms of just topping up the reserve. So hopefully, everybody understands that and recognizes it is what it is, but it is not a problem per se.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Langan,  UBS - Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And how often is that calculation done? Is that a quarterly analysis that you do or is that an annual?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, this particular adjustment is we conduct what are called sort of deep dives twice a year. It is in the first quarter and the third quarter. So that is why it is happening in this quarter. And if I go back, because I did go back to look at -- I expected that you guys might ask about what happened in the past. I am looking at 2013, and we actually didn't have much that was taking place in 2013. We had one quarter where we had some reserve adjustments going on, but coincidentally in that quarter we also had a supplier recovery on a particular action which sort of offset that. So that is why we didn't call either the recovery or the reserve adjustment up, because they were sort of offsetting each other.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Langan,  UBS - Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    One last question. I believe in your comments, you said that North America margins should be in the 8% to 9% range. You are starting off at 7.3%, and there is a lot of launch costs in the second half of the year. Is that still the valid range to think about for the full year, or did I mishear that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, absolutely. Because when you think about the first quarter, we were at 7.3%, including all the things that we have just been talking about, the weather issues, the reserve adjustment. So if you think about the run rate of the business in the quarter, we were nearly at 10% in North America. As the year progresses, we have a lot of new products that will be coming in addition to the F-Series. Some of that will give us some favorable product mix. This quarter, we had unfavorable series mix and options. But that will start to be offset by favorable product mix as the year progresses.
The other thing I think that is different than where we were three months ago, we guided to the fact that we thought North America would have negative pricing for the year. And certainly we see that in the quarter, but as we look ahead, I think we are starting to see the possibility of that being maybe more flat, maybe potentially somewhat positive because the overall environment has been a bit more positive, more disciplined across the industry in general than what we maybe thought would be the case three months ago. Mark, anything to add?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, just mentioned earlier, as we look at that 8% to 9%, we are looking at additional production opportunities on the current F-Series, which, all things being equal, could actually push us up in the upper range of that, but we have some more work to do.

    Ryan Brinkman, JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ryan Brinkman,  JPMorgan Chase - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. There have been a couple already on China and Asia Pacific, but I would like to approach it from a little bit different of an angle. Obviously, the results there are quite strong despite the impact of some pretty aggressive growth-related investments. So I am curious what comments that you could make regarding the potential earnings power of this region a few years out after which presumably we could see some tapering of the growth investments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, we've said, I think, Ryan, for quite a long time that we thought towards mid-decade or so that the region would contribute very meaningfully, significantly to the bottom line of the Company and I think that is still our point of view. We expect this to be one of the larger regions of the business going forward. It is the largest region of the world in terms of industry and we are making great progress in participating in that. We also have capacity increases that are still ahead of us. We have more expansion of our product portfolio ahead of us. As I mentioned earlier, we see India and Southeast Asia maybe lagging a bit behind where we are in China in terms of the maturity of our investments there. So I think that is an opportunity down the road, so I think we feel like this will be a region that will definitely be a meaningful significant contributor to Ford's bottom line.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ryan Brinkman,  JPMorgan Chase - Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, great, thanks. And then for my second and final question, I guess maybe just one on South America. You continue to take really a lot of price down there and at the same time, some of the vehicle production forecasters, IHS, etc., they have recently slashed their expectations for sales and production in the back half of the year a lot, including for you guys. So I wonder if you think that it might be a concern as we transition to a potentially I guess softer demand environment, that it might become more difficult to continue to offset with price the inflationary currency pressures as well as you have been in recent years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I think it is different by market. We are actually, at least up till now, we have been able to more or less, maybe it depends on timing of a quarter because we've seen such significant depreciation that sometimes you can't fully recapture that all in a quarter, but I think in the case of Venezuela and in the case of Argentina, we've seen better ability to, over a relatively reasonable period of time, to offset the effect of operating exchange weakness and/or local inflation. I think it is different in Brazil; it is a much more competitive environment. All that capacity, as you mentioned, that is coming in, it is making it I think a tougher place in order to capture -- to offset, if you will, the affects that I talked about.
I think the thing that is the positive for us though is the complete transformation of the portfolio, all the new products that are coming in, some still ahead of us because we are seeing an extremely favorable response from consumers both in terms of what it has done for us in share, but also our ability to get a really healthy price, a transaction price for those products. But nonetheless, Brazil is -- we have been talking about this for some time of being a concern around the competitive environment and all the capacity coming in.

    (multiple speakers). I appreciate all the color.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The only other thing I'd add is to Bob's point about the product lineup and working on the revenue side. As you can imagine, following our process of looking at the business environment, the team there is very focused on looking at -- optimizing our footprint that we have down there. We are working on our logistical costs, which are very important, material cost reductions, seeing where we can accelerate localization actions and just overall structural cost improvements. So we are working both sides of the profit equation for that part of the world.

Rod Lache,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning, everybody. I was hoping -- just not to harp on this too much -- but the field service charge is a pretty big number. Can you just elaborate on how much of it is related to adjusting the pattern estimation model, how much of it is discrete and how much is older vehicles? You did mention that there were some 2001 to 2005 vehicles in there, which obviously is going to raise some questions in light of what some others are dealing with. So what is the issue there and maybe if you could just say specifically what is the issue with the 2001 to 2005 models?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, and they are all public. We have about $400 million associated with the field service actions. Of that, about $350 million relates to the 2009 through 2013 model years -- is it 2008, 2009? 2008 through 2013 model years. We then have two issues that were for the older model years. We have a Crown Vic -- I think it is a Crown Vic Grand Marquis lighting control module that was a recall that was for the 2003 through 2005 model years. That was about maybe about $30 million, $40 million and then we had an Escape subframe issue that was roughly $30 million and that was 2001 through 2004. And then there was maybe about $10 million of just general offsets to all of that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rod Lache,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, so none of it (multiple speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Most of it is the reserve adjustments. The other two are relatively small.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rod Lache,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. So there is not like a review of historical vehicles or something like that that is unusual?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, no, no. Those are simply -- we are always looking at data to understand where we have issues. Those were things that clearly popped up and indicated that we had an issue and per our normal process addressed them ASAP.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rod Lache,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And just two more things, just your material costs have been, in North America, a really big offset to the price and mix recently through the past three quarters in a row. Obviously, it is dependent on timing of new launches. Could you just give us some thoughts on how we should be thinking about price mix versus materials looking forward? And then on China, you mentioned again that you have a lot of plants, six plants that are in launch and you'd previously said that higher launch costs are going to be a factor this year, but this quarter it seems like your cost structure was actually improved. So can you quantify the magnitude of the launch costs that you would anticipate for this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In the case of North America, for the full year, we still would expect to see I think positive material cost overall. We are seeing very good material cost reductions. We will have as the new products are introduced increases related to them, but because they are launching, if you will, more second half, if you will, at least a lot of the volume on a year-over-year base, the effect will be probably more in 2015 than in this year.
In the case of Asia Pacific, what we are seeing there is, as you said, the quarter doesn't indicate what we expect to see for the full year, but for the full year, we will see more cost come in and that will largely be around spending-related, manufacturing, more in terms of engineering and also advertising sales promotion as we launch and support the products. And then our general admin and expense selling will go up. Some of that related to Lincoln, some of it just related to the overall growth of the business that we need to put resources in place to support it. So it is really across I guess I'm saying all parts of the business, but it is going to be sort of a growth quarter by quarter as the business expands.

    Pat Archambault, Goldman Sachs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pat Archambault,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, thank you. Actually just sort of building on that last question on Europe, the losses were pared back more than I think a number of us had thought. Can you just give us a sense of sequentially how some of the cost cadence plays out because I guess you still have the big Mondeo launch at Valencia, which I imagine is going to be sort of a headwind and any other factors obviously we are not thinking about as we sort of try and model that out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I guess I would say, first of all, you know that there is sort of a pattern to profits in general in Europe. Usually the first half is better than the second-half third quarter. I don't think that was the case last year, but third quarter is usually a weaker quarter because of the extensive plant shutdowns that take place for holidays and so forth. Of course, all of that, as you said, Pat, is dependent upon particular cadence of product launches that we have over the course of the year. But, again, there, we have had some launches and we are launching actually some things right now in Europe, so I don't know that I'd call out any particular thing in terms of the cadence of our structural costs going forward. I think probably the fluctuations up and down will be more around volume levels and I don't think I would call anything else out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pat Archambault,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. That is helpful. And one other one on South America. Can you -- you might have said it, but can you kind of parse out what was sort of balance sheet remeasurement in Venezuela versus what was just kind of operating headwinds just from the lack of volume? And maybe can you give us a sense of just what you are seeing on the ground there? I mean it sounds like production is at a standstill. I understand visibility is poor, but what are the prospects for that to improve in coming quarters?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You are talking about Venezuela specifically?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pat Archambault,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So maybe, Mark, can comment on that. In terms of the balance sheet effects of the amount that we talked about on slide 7, $310 million of that is Venezuela specifically, about $70 million is related to Argentina. And then on a year-over-year basis, you can see on slide 14 the year-over-year basis, the balance sheet effect was roughly half of what we are seeing in total and of that, a good portion of that --well, actually most of the overall effect is actually Argentina and Venezuela, a bit of Brazil.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, from a volume standpoint and an industry standpoint in Venezuela, as we said last quarter, what we did in the fourth quarter of last year was literally cut our production by three quarters versus the running rate in the first three quarters of 2013 and what we mentioned is that is our assumption going forward the remainder of 2014. And when you look at the industry development to put it in perspective, the first quarter of last year, the Venezuelan industry was about 113,000 units on a SAAR basis. This year, it is 12,000 units. So I think we've baked those assumptions into our plan and we will continue to watch the environment there and also continue to support our Venezuelan customers at the same time minimize our exposures.

Itay Michaeli,  Citigroup - Analyst    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Great, thank you. Good morning. Just going back to the warranty item in the quarter, Bob, why wouldn't that also potentially impact other regions if you are assessing sort of the overall experience just given the Company's global platforms and commonality?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, because in part some of the products may not be in some of the regions. I mean we do the same reserve analysis everywhere. You also have different suppliers. In some cases, products are tailored to different designs, different powertrains. So they are global, but there are differences region by region. We also -- as we launch, we don't launch everything all at one time. So as we launch in one region, then the next and the next and the next, we kind of learn from the first region and we kind of build those learnings into launch at the next region, including design changes and so forth. So it is not all apples and apples, if you will.

    Sure. Then just second question, hoping to gauge your temperature on the mid-decade 8% to 9% margin outlook. I know in December you labeled it at risk citing Europe. It seems like Europe is probably going better, Asia is certainly going better, but South America going worse. Just maybe give us an update of what you are thinking. Is that more at risk, less at risk or roughly the same today than it was in December?

    Thanks for getting me in. A question on the credit line extension. Is that primarily being done to increase the captives liquidity or are you also expecting some higher CapEx than planned or even returning more cash to shareholders down the road?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, thanks for the question. No, it is just basically as we get bigger and as we continue to expand and grow, we thought it was prudent for us to take advantage of actually very strong interest from our global banking group and also very healthy capital markets for us to increase and extend the credit facility. The other thing that is kind of great about it is we are actually returning to sort of normal credit facility five-year terms. I think it is the first time we have been there for quite a number of years with this change. So we feel very positive about that too. So that is it; that is what is behind it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Whiston,  Morningstar - Analyst    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And the incentive spending in North America, I know you have got some pretty tough comps in the US given how well you guys have been doing there, but this quarter unfavorable headwinds from volume and mix combined with the incentive spending, are you guys more just playing defense now for now until the next generation F-Series is out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, I think overall when you look at our incentive spend, we look at our incentive spend in conjunction with our overall margins and transaction prices and when you look at our transaction prices, they are at the top end of the industry and it kind of reinforces the margin that we have in North America. Clearly, in a number of our products, they are kind of late in their lifecycle, so we are accounting for that. And also at the same time as those new products come on, that will offer us opportunities once those products are launched. That is kind of the way we are looking at it balanced and making sure we profitably grow and take care to that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And David, I would just add that, in the quarter comparison, which is what you are seeing on the data today, a bit of that is, if you will, a difficult comp because last year we had just launched the Kuga and we had just launched the Fusion. They were in very, very high demand. We had very tight supplies and so incentive levels for those products were very, very low and those are high-volume products for us. Now it is more normal, if you will.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Mr. Mulally, just to confirm and to clarify what you said earlier, I'm sorry that I have to ask about this, but there you go. Earlier, I believe you said you were going to stick to the plan in terms of succession and I think if I recall correctly, you said that you plan to serve through the end of 2014. Does that then indicate that the plan is that you will serve through the end of 2014? Can you clarify that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Mulally,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Jeff, no change to the plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff Flock,  Fox Business Networks - Media    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, I appreciate that clarification and the rumors that you are going to coach the Detroit Lions, is that still a nonstarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Mulally,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, that is very interesting, but Bill has a great plan for the Lions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff Flock,  Fox Business Networks - Media    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So just to confirm, no change to the plan that was announced earlier and the plan which was that you plan to serve through the end of 2014?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Mulally,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No change to the plan, Jeff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeff Flock,  Fox Business Networks - Media    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Copy that, sir. Appreciate it.

Karl Henkel,  Detroit News - Media    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning, gentlemen. One quick question, back to the warranty reserve. Is there any way that you can kind of put that in context? How big is that reserve and I guess being up $400 million versus Q1 of 2013 in that department, I guess what is a typical year-over-year increase when you look at the reserve directionally heading upward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks, Karl, two responses there. One, at the end of last year, our total warranty reserve, which would include for field service action of $3.9 billion for the Company and in terms of the second question, I mean this is an unusually large increase and as I mentioned earlier, if I go back and look at the four quarters of last year, we did not have something of this magnitude occur, so this is unusual. That is exactly why we are calling it out so that everybody understands the run rate of the business because you wouldn't expect something like this to happen quarter in and quarter out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Karl Henkel,  Detroit News - Media    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I guess is there any significant impact, as a follow-up, on just the global sales growth for Ford over the last few years and looking into the future having a significant impact on that number increasing further or am I kind of looking into that too much?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You mean related to the warranty reserve increase?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Karl Henkel,  Detroit News - Media    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I don't think so because, again, I think what you are seeing across the whole industry is all OEMs responding very, very quickly in general to the issues that they see. Vehicles have a lot more technology in them. They are far more complex. I just think that -- it just seems to be more of a general industry phenomenon and unfortunately, because we don't like product recalls on field service actions, unfortunately that has been our history as well over the last couple of years, but it is really an industry phenomenon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And also, Karl, if you look from our perspective, we are really pleased with the quality levels we are seeing. Clearly all-time record highs in some parts of the world and even here in the US, we are starting to see some encouraging quality data, which hopefully will then lead through to better performance based on the reserves we set up. But, as we said, we are very committed to delivering best-in-class quality to our customers and everybody is focused on that and encouraging (technical difficulty).

Mike Ramsey,  Wall Street Journal - Media    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi, good morning. Karl kind of stole some of my thunder, but -- so if I say that the warranty reserve is reflective of a larger number of recalls over the last several years, not just for Ford, but also for the industry, is that an accurate statement?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, the warranty reserves are going up because of our experience. What I am trying to say is that our experience though is not necessarily unique, if you will, to the automotive industry. You are seeing more and more companies, a higher number of recalls, a higher number of units being affected and that is an industry phenomenon, but what drives our warranty reserves is our experience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Ramsey,  Wall Street Journal - Media    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And just as a follow-up, I think, gosh, it was 2007, wasn't there the inverse of this that was beneficial? There was a big readjustment of warranty reserves sometime, I think it was 2007. Am I crazy or does anyone remember this?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I think that is -- it could have been because one of the things that, as I mentioned, we only hold these reserves for about six or seven years. So when that oldest year, if you will, is ready to run off as we move into the next calendar year, if there is anything left in that reserve that hasn't been used, we release it. So it is possible that that could have happened back in 2007, somewhere in that timeframe. I actually remember something like that as well, Mike, but I know we've had situations like that.

Alisa Priddle,  Detroit Free Press - Media    [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning, gentlemen. Just first a question for Mark. If you could just clarify, when you say you want to get more production of current F-150s, so are you talking about running more overtime in plants or changing the changeover schedule or what kinds of things are you looking at?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [90]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We are working very closely with our supply base in terms of seeing if they can support some additional production opportunities and that may mean running more overtime at some of our -- whether it is Dearborn Truck as we run out the existing model and get ready for the new one or in Kansas City where, as you know, we are not launching that plant till next year. So yes, it is so far encouraging, more work to do, but it involves the whole team and the good news, Alisa, is it is really based on market demand and as we said, if you look at the month of March, it's another month where we sold over 70,000 F-Series, so the demand is out there. Customers really like the product, the existing product and we are going to try to get as many as we can to them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alisa Priddle,  Detroit Free Press - Media    [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. So you are not talking about changing any of the dates of changeover?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alisa Priddle,  Detroit Free Press - Media    [93]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Those are locked in.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [94]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Those are locked in. We are making more out of the time we do have.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alisa Priddle,  Detroit Free Press - Media    [95]

    And then, Alan, so it sounds like you will still be with us on the next earnings call.

    No change, Alisa. Thank you.

    John Murphy, Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Murphy,  Bank of America Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [99]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning, guys. Just two quick questions for you. First, when you guys were on slide 12 and talking about the drivers of a slight marketshare deterioration, you mentioned daily rent and small cars declining. It seems like that is kind of a trend that has been happening, but also something you might be doing more actively as your larger vehicles are getting more fuel-efficient and particularly as we think forward to the launch of the F-150 where you guys have alluded to the fact that it will be net accretive to your CAFE measurements and standalone on its own. Are we sort of seeing the precursor in the potential for you to deemphasize the not so profitable small car business as we go forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [100]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Absolutely not. We are focused on delivering what customers want and it has not really driven -- those are kind of not the way we are thinking about it. We are thinking very much from a customer and a market end standpoint. As you know, we are doing well with our car lineup, we are doing well with our truck lineup and we are going to go wherever the customer demands with that full family of vehicles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Murphy,  Bank of America Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [101]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. But if they demand larger more fuel-efficient vehicles and not many small cars, you will go that direction, you will go where the market goes?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Mulally,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [102]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, we are always going to match capacity to demand in the context of running a good business and a profitably growing business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Murphy,  Bank of America Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [103]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And then a second question, you guys mentioned $2 billion of the new credit facility would be allocated to Ford Motor Credit. Just curious what that is relative to history and are we seeing more capital being allocated to Ford Motor Credit so you can grow that business significantly sort of similar to where it was historically?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [104]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, we haven't done that before and we are doing that so that we can allow them to diversify their overall funding structure. So it is just a better balance sheet for Ford Credit and supports their own overall funding structure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Murphy,  Bank of America Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [105]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So it is less of a reliance on the securitization market and more of a reliance on your on-balance sheet financing though?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [106]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It is also to support -- we had something called FCAR in the past, which we are actually moving away from and we are going to replace that with more unsecured debt and this is just part of supporting that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Murphy,  Bank of America Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [107]

    Okay, great. Thank you.
