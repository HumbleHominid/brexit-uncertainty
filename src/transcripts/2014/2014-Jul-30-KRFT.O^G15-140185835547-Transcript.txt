Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Kraft Foods Incorporated reports second-quarter results conference call. 
(Operator Instructions) 
As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. 
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Chris Jakubik, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - Head of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon and thanks for joining our business update for the second quarter of 2014. With me today are Tony Vernon, our CEO, and Teri List-Stoll our CFO. 
During our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties and these are discussed in our press release. 
We'll also be referring to some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our press release and in the Investor Center of Kraftfoodsgroup.com. 
Now, I'll handed over to Tony and Teri to discuss our first-half results, as well as the current state of our business. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Chris. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Hopefully, you've had a chance to review our financials in the press release we issued about an hour ago. 
As expected, our quarter-two results were driven by the shift in Easter-related shipments to the second quarter this year, as well as the implementation of some significant pricing actions across a good portion of our portfolio. 
For Kraft, the second quarter brought a rare confluence of activity. We appropriately addressed rising commodity costs with price increases on 50% of our portfolio. The right move for the long term. 
In the short term, we took those actions in the face of an intensely promotional holiday quarter, with a late Easter, Memorial Day and July 4th add periods. When you combine that with our retail customers' need to market and price aggressively to strapped families across America, you have the recipe for an increase in trade spending versus the second quarter of last year. That indeed is what happened. 
We also saw mixed execution in certain parts of the business, which held back our potential year to date. We'll talk more about that in a moment. 
That being said, we are on track for another solid year of growth in earnings and cash flow, consistent with what we initially laid out to you in early February. As you've heard from almost every one of our peers, the ability to drive profitable growth in the food and beverage industry is challenged by a number of headwinds. For Kraft, we remain focused on executing against our play-book, and today we'll provide more details on what's working, what needs improving and what we're doing about it. 
We'll start with our financials. I'll turn it over to Teri to talk you through the results we just reported and where we stand versus our goals for the year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Let me start by briefly building on Tony's comments regarding our second-quarter results. Organic net revenue was up 1.5 point and reflected the expected benefit of the Easter shift, but also some buying softness, as we implemented significant pricing in response to input cost increases. 
On a profit side, when we take out the market-based impacts from post-retirement plans in last year's numbers, as well as the change in spending on cost savings initiatives, and the unrealized gains and losses from hedging in both years, that's the way most of you look at it, three things: Gross profit dollars were down as a significant run-up in input costs outpaced the pricing and productivity benefits we've realized to date. Operating income dollars were up mid-single digits as we continued to deliver progress in overheads. Our earnings were relatively flat versus the prior year, largely due to an unfavorable tax impact. 
As we said on our first-quarter call, our first-half results would be a much better indicator of where we stand against our expectations and our industry than looking at either quarter one or quarter two in isolation. In interest of time and relevance, we're going to focus our upfront comments today on our first-half results. 
During the first half of this year, our sales and share performance were both adversely impacted by the temporary dislocation we typically see when we're climbing the commodity cost curve. We've moved aggressively in the space of what are truly unprecedented price levels in certain parts of our commodity basket. 
For instance, dairy prices continue to redefine price ceilings as we progress through the first half of the year. With the average prices of barrel cheese, block cheese, and milk during the second quarter, each at record levels. We responded with price increases of between 5% and 12% across most of our cheese portfolio. These actions took effect at the end of March and we're seeing competitors priced off at the run up in their in food costs on a typical lagged basis. 
In meats, beef, turkey and pork prices for our cold cuts have continued to increase and are at record highs as we speak. If you remember from our last call, Oscar Mayer announced pricing across approximately 50% of its cold cuts portfolio with an average increase of 10% and that was effective May 25. As of today, competitors have not yet moved in a material way to offset their costs, but it's still early by historical standards. 
On a year-to-date basis, we've implemented or announced price increases on products representing approximately half of our portfolio. For almost 20% of our portfolio, we've had to increase prices at a double-digit rate. As a result, we've seen some dislocation in market share and growth versus the broader industry year to date. 
Let me give you some numbers that characterize the impact. Let's start with market share. Through the first half, we continue to gain or hold share in roughly 60% of our business on a trailing 52-week and year-to-date basis. That number slipped to almost 50% in quarter two. The recent slippage is primarily attributable to the categories where we've taken pricing. 
As far as growth versus the broader food and beverage industry, year to date, our 40 basis point decline in organic growth is trailing industry growth of roughly 1.5%. That's mainly due to weakness in some of our meals and desserts and beverages categories. 
In terms of our goal to deliver profitable growth at or above industry levels, we've had an uphill climb on the growth element so far this year, but we do expect to make up ground as we get past the near-term dislocation of leading on some very significant pricing actions that are absolutely critical in light of the commodity cost increases we are facing. 
Having said that, we continue to feel good about the profitable part of the equation. That is, our ability to manage total costs through pricing, productivity savings, and smart spending in SG&A over the course of the year, and still deliver against our long-term profit growth algorithm. 
While the external environment has no doubt created challenges so far this year, we've created some of our own obstacles. When we take a close look in the mirror, it's clear our report card is mixed from an operating perspective during the first half of the year, and it's held back our potential in terms of sales and profits. 
On the positive side, where we've executed well, we're seeing progress. In the innovation and renovation area, on a launch-to-date basis, we're doing well on the distribution and consumption metrics we track. 
With all the pricing we are putting in place, the price elasticity we've experienced to date has been in line to better than we expected. Importantly, we've been most successful where we've priced with product news, for example, Deli Fresh Bold lunch meats and Kraft Singles with no artificial preservatives. 
That being said, we have more work to do. For instance, in a couple of our businesses, meals and desserts and parts of beverages, we relied more on promotional and coupon activity in the second quarter than we would want to, a promotional trap that's bitten many in our industry. 
In this environment, it is easy to fall prey to price discounting as a way to fill a temporary shortfall in gross revenue or volume and to look to get a short-term boost in productivity from the volume leverage that occurs in the plants. But these activities can hold us back in our ability to realize the benefits of our PNOC, or pricing net of commodity cost, discipline. Year to date we are negative in this area, and the main reason we are a bit off track is due to the factors that I cited where we over relied on promotions. 
The other area where I would say we need to improve is process discipline. As we balance major renovation work with ongoing day-to-day operational excellence. 
As we've talked to you about before, we must become more agile in our operations. This is not only in terms of managing the seas of change that we've talked about, but also in our base operations, including the start up of new initiatives, both renovations and innovations. 
We continue to invest in our people to develop capabilities across all facets of our business, from marketing through to operations. We continue to build the process discipline that's the foundation of our Lean Six Sigma efforts, but we're not where we need to be as evidenced by some of our start up issues and the product recalls we have had over the past six months. 
None of them, individually, has been of a size to have a material impact on our overall enterprise-wide results versus prior year. In each case, we identified the issue, analyzed the root cause, and have recovered quickly. It has impacted us financially, in the sense that they've taken away from our potential sales, potential profits, and hurt our net productivity. 
Here are some numbers. In the second quarter, we booked recall costs of just over $10 million. However, when we step back and we estimate the total cost of the recalls we've seen this year, including opportunity costs like lost sales, it's more like 3 to 4 times that impact to the potential top line in income operating income we could have generated. 
Given these factors, it's not surprising we're running a bit behind our ongoing 2.5% annual net productivity target so far this year. It's entirely due to the challenges we've had balancing major renovation and ongoing manufacturing excellence initiatives. Great companies can drive change and maintain world-class performance at the same time, and we need to do better here. 
Now, both of these impacts, the PNOC and the productivity, are imminently fixable and we're doing the right things to make up lost ground as we progress through the year. In fact, as we look at the first half of the year, despite some lost potential, our first-half results are consistent with the first-half/second-half seasonality we've described in the past. That is, roughly half of our sales and a bit more than half of our earnings coming in the first half of the year. 
As we look at the second half, it's more the unforeseen external factors that could take us off track from where we stand today. For example, like a need to take significant additional price increases and the temporary dislocation that goes along with them late in the year, or further escalation in promotional activity in the industry. 
Let me close by talking about cash, as always, a significant area of focus for us. Our free cash flow for the first six months was just over $450 million, up double digits. 
We did have a significant increase in inventory levels, largely from rising input costs. While we were coming off a low inventory base at the end of last year, this remains an area of focus for us. 
However, that was more than offset by the benefit of lower pension contributions as we continue to sustain a comfortable funded status of our plans. Net, we're fully on track with cash year to date, and in a cash-is-king type of business, that's a number we're feeling really good about right now. 
Overall, we remain focused on delivering against  the goals for 2014 that we provided to you in early February, even in the face of what has been a very difficult operating environment. 
Which is a good point for me to hand it back to Tony. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Teri. 
I wanted to spend some time today talking about the operating environment and the challenges we continue to face, both as Kraft and as an industry. We've been hearing a lot from our industry peers and the news hasn't been great. I'm often asked what's our take on the situation? And what are we doing about it? 
As an industry, top-line growth, and more specifically, profitable top-line growth has been and is likely to remain challenging in the near term. Many of you have written about this. Right now, industry returns on promotional activities, innovation, and even product renovation are lower than what we've seen in the past. 
You've seen the numbers on promotion. During the first half of 2014, of the largest 100 food and beverage categories, which represent over 80% of total food and beverage, nearly 2/3 increased the percent of dollar sales from promotions. Yet, the promotional efficiency to drive incremental sales did not hold pace, with only 45% of these categories showing improved promotional efficiency. And Kraft is right in line with those numbers. 
In light of these trends, we are going back and taking a harder look at some of our smaller innovations, smaller SKUs, and marginal marketing programs to decide where we continue to fish and where we need to cut bait and make sure we are living the principal of fewer, bigger, better. 
In our view, it's driven by the seas of change that we outlined at CAGNY in February: Consumers focused on value and nutrition and well being. Our customers coming to terms with changing shopper patterns and channel shifting. The rise of digital media, breaking established marketing principles and best practices. 
It's not just the confluence of changes, but the pace of the change. Even in the two years since we became an independent company, the pace of change has been dramatic. Yes, the pressure is great to drive traffic for our retailers and to respond to competitors price-based land grabs in like kind. The second quarter in particular was an intense, crowded holiday quarter given a late Easter, putting additional pressure on consumer wallets and customer traffic. 
The solution to all of this, for us, it's the play-book we've been talking about all along: brand innovation, reinventing marketing, and establishing brand ubiquity across channels. Equity building programs such as advertising, innovation, renovation, take time to effectively drive volume and profitable growth, so does building distribution in nontraditional channels. It all requires discipline and we need to stay sharp on this point. 
In some ways, we have to unlearn what we believed to work in the past and re-learn what will make a difference today. In the short term, adjusting to such momentous shifts favors the smaller, more nimble players that are working from a small base. I think that's what you're seeing play out in the most recent set of financial results across the food and beverage industry. 
There's no doubt that, even with the changes in consumer behavior and the tools we use to communicate with them, consumers staples is and will still be an industry that sees real benefits from scale. Our teams know it. And I'm encouraged by the collaboration I've seen among our business units to share best practices and key learnings. 
It is no small coincidence that our cheese, nut, coffee, and meats businesses are all improving. They are sharing their best practices to build these businesses to last, even in the face of rapidly rising commodity costs. 
There's no better evidence of the benefits of scale than the success of P3, Kraft Cheese, Planters Nuts, and Oscar Mayer meat in one protein pack. Our breadth of expertise, shared insights, and our scale is what will help Kraft win together. 
I love what I've seen on the scale programming front, which has brought excitement and foot traffic to our retailers, while delivering solid returns. These things are foundational to our play-book and, in our view, they are what will provide the best returns. 
But make no mistake, this is not a quick fix. It's about consumer insights, big ideas, innovation, and developing talent that can execute with discipline and excellence and understanding that you don't bat 1,000 in this game. The good news for Kraft is that we're well positioned to drive profitable growth while we execute our play-book. 
I've said before, that it's a good time to be at Kraft, and I think it's even more true now than it was at the time of our spinoff. We have a significant opportunity to grow our brands and we're putting a high priority on brand innovation, renovation, marketing reinvention, and extending channel penetration of key brands, large and small. 
Take A1 Original sauce for example. We've repositioned this brand and launched a well integrated social media and traditional marketing campaign to move A1 beyond steak and broaden its appeal to new consumers, like Millennials who are cooking up different types of protein for dinner. 
Consumption is up 3% since the campaign launched versus a 3% decline pre campaign. Share is up 0.5 point year to date, and A1 is starting to grow household penetration for the first time in years. 
We can do this on big brands as well. Philadelphia cream cheese, for example. We've talked about the renovation and supply chain improvements on Philly over the past several months, and it's paying off. Behind the proprietary positioning around freshness, from farm to table in six days, our market shares, in all forms of cream cheese, brick, soft, and whipped, are all up. 
Customer and consumer response to the renovation of our Philly soft cream cheese spreads that launched in March has been terrific. Philly's share of the soft cream cheese segment is up 0.5 points, and retail sales across all outlets are up 5%. 
Brand renovations are a must if we are to keep our brands relevant. It is and will be one of our biggest areas for investment. We'll continue to innovate to extend our brands into new consumption occasions like we have with our Keurig-compatible cups. We've created a $200 million plus business from a standing start just 18 months ago. 
Innovation, overall, continues to be critical to keeping our brands' relevance. We continue to be very excited about the success of our Gevalia brand, P3, as well as Lunchables Uploaded and Kabobbles. I'm glad that's doing well because I just like saying Kabobbles. 
Marketing reinvention is also a big opportunity for Kraft, and we'll talk more about it in our back-to-school presentation in early September. We've made good progress and have some strong growth rates from extending into new channels. It's still early. It's a small base, but I like the momentum. 
Managing total cost to protect investments continues to be a key foundational priority. Bob Gorski talked a lot about the drill sites within our supply chain about a year ago, but there's more we can do in other parts of our business, including overheads. We are going after it. We continue to take appropriate pricing actions to offset rising input costs when and where we need it. 
We will not lose our focus on cash and free cash flow productivity, so we can continue to invest while delivering the dividend to shareholders that we committed to. We also continue to evaluate all options to accelerate the remaking of Kraft into a best-in-class food and beverage company. 
Our approach is the same as we laid out almost two years ago. We wrapped and stacked our opportunities, internal and external, on a risk-adjusted return basis and go after what's at the top of the list. As return profiles change, so does our list. 
We've also talked about the environment today through the consumer lens. We are also well aware of the increased activity in the food industry on the M&A front and in some of the categories in which we compete. Now, you've asked me the question before, so you know the answer. We're going to look at everything and talk about nothing. 
To wrap things up, our first-half results were consistent with our typical first-half/second-half revenue and profit seasonality, despite some considerable headwinds. It is a challenging environment, but we like our chances. While we continue to make headway in executing our play-book, we know there's still more work to do. 
With that, we look forward to your questions.

Hi. Good afternoon.

Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Bryan. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess a question for both Tony and Teri. 
Tony, you spent a lot of time talking about a lot of the headwinds that the industry is facing, that you faced this year. Teri, you spoke about some of the execution issues. At the same time, you are still talking about the year being in line with your expectations you had going into the year. 
Can you talk a little bit about, first, in terms of expectations, if I recall it correctly, it was to grow in line with your algorithm and then there were some one-time items that would be layered on top of it. Just understanding that that's still what we're talking about? 
Second to that, as we just our to look forward, it was remarkable that you delivered the earnings you did this quarter with growth gross profit dollars actually being down. If you could talk a little bit about just how you would think about gross profits tracking going forward? I'm assuming just the pricing catching up to the cost of goods sold. How you'd look at margins or gross margin improvement going forward? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Well, we'll start, Bryan, and if we miss some things you'll can come back and tell us whether we did or not. 
Maybe the place to start is to reiterate what we said, which is that we are committed to our plan and we feel good about the prospects we have remaining. If you look at our first-half delivery, it is consistent with the seasonality we typically see, which is about half of our revenues and a little more than half of our profits in the first half of the year. When you look at that, we are on pace to what we promised in February, and that's the plan that we are committed to. 
We did say upfront that we would have a slow start the year. On the top line, we came into the year with a bit of an inventory build to the customers that we had to work through and we saw that in the first half. 
On the bottom-line basis, we're climbing a pretty steep commodity cost curve, and so we have those cost impacts and the pricing benefit tend to lag some of that. You also get some of the volume dislocation we talked about in the quarter. 
I think, in most respects, what we're seeing is largely what we expected could play out at the beginning of the year when we talk to you. You talked about, okay, well what happens in the second half? 
We did talk about the fact that we do have, with the cost savings initiatives, we have lower spending this year than last year. So, that's a bit of a reconciling items that we put to the side, and we focus on the underlying excluding that. 
Our views on year really haven't changed. We are committed to the long-term growth algorithm. We have a plan. We are executing the plan. We need to execute it better, and that's really what we are committed to.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi. This is Vishal Patel in for Ken. 
I wanted to ask about cost restructuring. While I understand that cost restructuring is ongoing at Kraft, it seems like it's maybe expanded towards attacking overheads. Can you talk a little bit more about that? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I'll let Teri help me, but we've done a very good job in overhead as you know. I think we've cut 500 basis points over the last three years. You know that we set out with our scale and size to be the leanest, most nimble company around the major players, and we're doing a good job against it. 
If there's more to get, we're going to get it. My comment in the script was saying that we're always looking at this and benchmarking it, and we think there are opportunities to get leaner, and we're going to get them over time. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When we rolled out the evolution of our play-book into play-book 2.0 at CAGNY, we broadened our focus from just productivity to total-cost management for the very reason that we do want to drive a culture of productivity all throughout the Company. That focus on simplification and efficiency in costs savings stands all elements of our cost structure, and that's really what we wanted to convey as well.

Robert Moskow,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi. Thank you. 
SG&A in the quarter was well below what I had expected. You talked about, Tony, falling into the trap of short-term discounting. 
Can you give us a sense as to what's happened to the advertising budget for the year? Just speak broadly, you've talked very passionately about the need for reinvesting into the business and that is part of your long-term plan. To what extent is this year going to be maybe a step backwards, I suppose, in those types of brand investments? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. You read me right, Rob, our objective is to continue building our share of voice to competitive levels. We were relatively flat in Q2, but we were up in the first half, consistent with our algorithm. 
I'm not going to give you a number going forward, but we do want to make sure that the advertising we put out there is returning profitably. With an eye to efficiency, we're going to continue to invest in these brands. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just for completeness, that SG&A line has also benefited from a reduction of overhead spending, so we do have that that benefit flowing through as well. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Moskow,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The difference between this year and last year is pretty vast, Teri. Is most of that -- some of it must be the restructuring spending, too, but is most of the reduction overhead cost and should we reflect that in our second half as well? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you take out the differential and the cost savings initiatives, the restructuring spending, the remaining change in that is more due true to overhead. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Moskow,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Alright. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, everybody. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, Andrew. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two things, Tony, stood out to me a little bit from some of your prepared remarks. The first one was this promotional and couponing activity that you fell into a little bit in the quarter. One of the things that's so critical to the way Kraft laid out your growth algorithm over time was a much more modest and reasonable top-line growth algorithm, such that you could focus a lot more on profitable volume and not just go after share for share sake. 
The first question is, how did this couponing process happen? How do you keep it from happening again going forward? 
The second was, productivity is such, clearly, a huge part of the thesis around Kraft at this stage. To be running behind on that, because of executional issues, I guess, is somewhat troubling, so I'd love  a little bit more perspective on what specifically were the issues? Was it going after productivity in too aggressively or too quickly, or in the wrong places? 
A little bit more perspective there would be helpful. Because these would seem like they're key issues around the stock, really, as I think about it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. I'll take part one and Terry's going to take part two. 
I think it was an unusual quarter, for all of us in the industry. I think you have to be careful when looking at it relative to the fact that, in the same quarter, we took price on 50% of our brands as we dealt with retailers who had three holidays in the quarter. 
While I feel that we probably left too much coupon and price happen in a few categories, I think overall we were quite disciplined. I think the few that we probably fell into the trap a bit was especially dinners. Dinners, as you know, is probably the most important segment in the center of the store. 
We have an incumbent competitor who was pricing very aggressively and you have a retailer who needs to build traffic in dinners because it is so critical to the overall performance of the store. With all of the action and the price we took, we dealt back some of that price during the quarter, so you saw a big impact on meals. 
We also saw it, honestly, in Capri Sun, which I think you know is one of the very important seasonal items in the Kraft line. We held our price at a level that we felt would grant us the merchandising. 
Two lessons learned, as we go forward, we're going to look hard at the returns we get  through these things. I don't think we're going to have this, what I call the rare confluence of events, for quite a few years. We'll get more disciplined to ensure that we continue to manage the algorithm you described. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll turn it to Teri for the second one. If that's okay? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. On the productivity side, Andrew, as we talked about in the base part of the call, a lot of, substantially all of the differential we're seeing between our long-term goal and productivity and what we've seen so far in the first half of the year, has been these more executional issues where we've had start up issues with some of our innovations. We've had the recall impacts. That does have a pretty significant impact on our net productivity. 
It has nothing to do with what we see as the population of opportunities in terms of drill sites and the ability to deliver productivity in the long term. We continue to feel, as Bob Gorski has described, that that is a very long ball game ahead of us to go after. 
In the quarter, and in the half, we haven't deliver that largely because of poor execution, which is, as I said, imminently fixable. We just need to buckle down and deliver with excellence.

Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri, are you still looking for $150 million in restructuring for the full year? Because you're still running, obviously, well below half of through the first half of the year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, that's still our best guess at this point. We knew that it was going to be more back-half loaded, and so we're pretty much on where we expected to be and that is, I think, a reasonable estimate at this stage.

Hi, everyone. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, Matt. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew Grainger,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just two questions, if I could. 
One, just to come back to the issue of profitable reinvestments. Could you talk a little bit more about progress on Maxwell House during the quarter? You talked about higher promo spend in beverages, which seems largely attributable to Capri Sun. 
There was clearly some activity and some advertising earlier in the quarter on Maxwell House. It's not clear whether that's continued fully into Q3, so could you just give us an update and whether you were happy with the initial results of the marketing campaign there? 
Then, just a quick follow up. Could you talk a bit about operating dynamics in Canada? We've heard about some of your larger retailers becoming more active and asking for discounts and promotional support. I know you had unfavorable PNOC there, so just what you're seeing in the market and whether it's cause for concern? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Good question, Matt. 
I think we are making significant strides in rejuvenating coffee across all three segments; pods, premium, with Gevalia and Maxwell House. I think Maxwell House is on a nice, positive run here. The team has done a good job making sure it's the combination of the play-book, innovation, good/better/best pricing and the full application of our positioning and advertising. I feel quite good about our coffee progress, overall, and Maxwell House in particular. 
Second part of the question, remind me -- it was Canadian retail? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew Grainger,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have a pay-for-performance system in Canada. We have a very similar trade relationship that we have here, and we haven't seen impact. We're the biggest player in grocery. 
We haven't seen the impact of what you're describing. Clearly, it's a consolidated market, and clearly, we have to continue to execute our play-book, maintain our leverage, with what are very good customers and sharp customers. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew Grainger,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Great. Thanks, Tony.

Good afternoon, everyone. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, Alexia. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alexia Howard,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company - Analyst    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi. You called out JELL-O a couple of times as being problematic in that particular segment. In addition to the category declines, it looks as though you're losing out to Kozy Shack by Land O'Lakes, and it looks like a 500 basis point shift year to date. 
Is that one of the issues? They seem to be pushing their simple ingredient message quite hard. 
Do you need to reformulate in there given the issues, or is it just not worth it because the category is declining so rapidly? Just a little bit on the strategy in there and how do you avoid being caught out like that in some of the other categories that are out there? Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I did mention this in the script. 
The smaller players who are innovating quickly and, frankly, quite well, are getting a receptive audience in our retailers because of the need for innovation. I do think in the short term it has an impact. I do think JELL-O is a very important brand, and we have to continue on all fronts improve it. 
Mostly, the pressure's coming from the sweet yogurts, the Kozy health and wellness play. Clearly, in our play-book, across all of our brands, has got to make sure that the health and wellness benefit that our R&D group has done such a good job with in many of our cheese categories, that we exercise it our center-of-store categories. 
On the JELL-O business, we've got to increase the velocities to give the customers what they've come to depend on from JELL-O. We've got fresh eyes on the business, and we'll get back to you with progress reports as we go.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, David. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Driscoll,  Citigroup - Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just two questions. One's just a numeric question and then a question for you, Tony. 
You mentioned that net productivity was behind. Can you actually give us an update as to what the number is? So, if you target 2.5% and you're ready behind, is it zero? What's of the ballgame that we're looking at for 2014? 
Then, the second question relates to the coffee business. Specifically, Tony, love your comments about the $200 million business from the standing start and take up, but we've got the big launch of the Keurig 2.0. Are you expecting to lose shelf space and or are you going to launch a compatible product? Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll handle their productivity question and let Tony take the other one. 
On the productivity, we aren't going to disclose a specific number. We don't get down to that level of detail, but I can tell you we did have productivity benefits in the quarter and first half, but running below the 2.5%. 
As we look forward to the year, that's really what we're focused on delivering is against the 2.5%. It's got some challenges in getting to that number given the start to the year, but with the plans we have in place, the ideas we've identified, that's clearly exactly what the team is fully focused on delivering. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David, to your great question on Keurig. We're very excited about the $200 million plus that we got, and we don't see that momentum stopping in this new environment that everyone's anticipating. 
We like being in control of our own destiny. It's all about the profitable growth in that category, and we think, in any scenario, we'll continue to do quite well and build share.

David Palmer,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks. That's RBC. Good evening. 
You noted that competitors have not materially followed on pricing on some categories. I assume that would center on the cheese business, perhaps you can confirm on that? 
You mentioned that it's still early, but it looks like it's been a couple months where you been running high on price and having some volume issues within cheese. Does it feel like the competition is taking a relatively long time? Any color on that on what's going on in cheese would be helpful? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The only color is this has been within standard timeframes we've seen. We feel quite good about how cheese has hung in there given the situation. 
It's nothing out of the ordinary. Feel great about our cheese business, overall. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Palmer,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just one last one. 
You've been making an effort to remove artificial colors, flavors, preservatives. Where do you stand on this effort and has that had any measurable, positive impact you can share? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think it's an important, developing renovation for our business and the industry. It started, for us, with Oscar Mayer Selects that I talked about many times in previous calls where we removed the chemical preservative and replaced it with a natural. It did very well in that business, and have really expanded it across the line. 
Yes, we feel great about the recent moves we made, including removing preservatives from Kraft Singles, and yes, we do believe it's going to have a material impact on our business and our health and wellness profile. We owe it to the consumer to offer these options.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Feeney,  Athlos Research - Analyst    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon. Thanks. Couple of questions and just a clarification, please. 
First, when you make the decision to participate in discounting activity in a category like dinner, you must believe that's going to drive purchase behavior somewhere, but you're not getting a lift. Does your data indicate that volumes would be even worse if you didn't discount? Or does it indicate that maybe there's a more optimal way to come at that trade off? 
Secondly, related to that, do you worry that when you discount within a category -- again using dinner as an example, but I'm really trying to get the philosophy here -- that you trigger reactions outside that category within say the dinner occasion, so it's category like soup and frozen foods and canned foods that are actually going to feel some pressure and respond in time in pricing? Does that way on your thoughts process as you think about a decision like that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good questions, Jonathan. 
Part one, it's all about profitable growth in the equation. Remember, decisions about pricing promotion have a lot to do in our world and big-brand world with productivity in plants and how much you can push through an efficient plant systems. With Lean Six Sigma we've become much more efficient, so we weigh it all in the equation. 
I did quote the industry data on the impact of promotions, and its declining. I think we're all getting much sharper in this. 
As to the second part of the business, we do measure Kraft Macaroni & Cheese against the broader category definition, and we do think about the competitive environment as we take our promotional decisions. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Feeney,  Athlos Research - Analyst    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess you're comfortable with the effect that's having? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. We are comfortable, I would say we've got to get sharper. Meals is so important in that center of the store, and I'm talking broader meals. I think if you talk to any retailer, they'd say they're depending on us and some of the other big players to bring the consumer back to the store with that meals business. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Feeney,  Athlos Research - Analyst    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got you. Just one clarification, Teri, you mentioned -- I just want to make sure I know all the cash flow goals. Your cash-flow targeted 90% in both of earnings, right? Are there any other cash flow targets that I don't know about? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, we've shifted to a free cash flow productivity measure as a better way for us to drive the organizational behavior.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi. Good evening. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, Chris. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi. I just had two questions, if I could, as well. A bit of a follow on to Jonathan's question our promotional activity. 
There was a comment in the release that says that there was something like lower expenditures on in-store activity. That's obviously not promotional related spending your referring to there, is that correct? Or maybe you could define what that refers to? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think, in that release it refers to display activity. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. So are you getting less display activity, but your promoting more heavily? I'm just trying to understand the balance there. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the risk of getting to accountant like, I'll out tackle that question and tell you why it's important is. 
That in-store activity that Tony described is largely part of our advertising marketing spend, which is a below the line item. As we've shifted some of that money intended for those kinds of activities to promotional activities, pricing related, couponing activities, those actually show up as a deduction from gross revenue to come to our net revenue. 
So, you get a double whammy of it's turning out that spending isn't as efficient as we would like it to be and it's showing up as a deduction from gross revenue to get to net. Because if we step back on the quarter, our gross revenue really was about in line with where we expected.  But when you take all that shift to couponing activity from what was thought to be in the marketing line, you get an additional hit on revenue. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. That's helpful and actually it was leading into my second question, which was is the intention then, Tony, to have less promotion and more advertising? Is it a matter of getting that mix to switch back? Is that the idea? 
Related to that, is the promotional spending in the quarter that occurred, did it reduce, obviously, it does reduce the price realization you are going to show. I had modeled more price realization in the quarter. I see it in cheese, but I didn't see it across some other divisions. Is it because promotional spending was so much higher? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's two pieces to that. One, is this couponing shift of dollars. The other is, as Tony mentioned, the Easter shift brings a lot of promotional programming into the quarter. The combination of those are what give you a larger gap. 
Then, the last piece is on pricing. Even though we've taken a lot of pricing in the quarter, the cold cuts pricing didn't take effect until May 25, so quite late into the quarter from that revenue standpoint. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [76]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi. Good evening. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, Eric. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. A couple of, I guess follow ups at this point. 
Free cash flow productivity is running through the first half, using your numbers, at 45%. You highlight the growth in free cash flow, but the efficiency so far this year is way below your goal. How do I like get to a anywhere close to 90% for the year with that kind of number in the first half? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess if I just said trust us that probably wouldn't be adequate for you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Afraid not. Try again. (laughter) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two things, one, it definitely is below the goal for the year, but it isn't unexpected or inconsistent with our seasonal pattern. Typically, this second quarter, in particular, is where we have the biggest working capital demand. The second-half cash flow generation, historically, is much better and that's exactly what we had predicted and expect for 2014. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Second question, related to the free cash flow. 
Your debt is about the same versus the year end. You've said that you've grown your free cash flow, yet there didn't seem to be any stock buyback. 
In reference to your comments, Tony, do you think like M&A is that's the thing that (technical difficulty) on the plate because it doesn't seem like you're buying back stock and the dividends (technical difficulty) essentially? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just as a point of clarification, we actually did buy back stock. So far in the first half we've bought $235 million in shares. You don't see it if you just look at the shares outstanding because with the stock price increase, we've had a higher degree of option exercises, so that mitigates the fact a little bit. 
We do have $235 million of share repurchases so far this year. That program didn't start until late February is when we really got it put in place. You'll see continued activity over the remainder of the year there. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding M&A, Eric, obviously the environment's heated up. Our approach is the same, as we said. We consider everything. We're never going to say never, and we talk about nothing. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just want to follow up on this promotion question. I realize there's been a lot of that. 
When you talk about coupons, are you talking about basically price allowance to the retailers? Because a normal coupon redemption is like 1% or 2% in the industry. 
You've raised prices, call it $230 million versus a year ago, if I say 50% is up 10%. I mean, you would have to be like, assuming like a massive amount of couponing to the consumer or just a massive redemption rate, if half of that spend back of your pricing was coupons. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, just a clarification on couponing. 
Our FSI redemption in the big brands is multiple-folds higher than your number. The most important dynamic in couponing today is the stacking that's going on enabled by the Internet. Really all of us are working through what is an incredible change in how the consumer's able to process a coupon and stack them up even with a retailer loyalty program and FSI, maybe one they had from another offer, buy this money Kraft's and get this off. 
You can stack them all together, now, and if we're not careful the consumer's getting a discount that's more than they need. That's what's really happening. 
Keep in mind on your price calculation, Paelties comment about the price realization was scattered throughout the quarter. Oscar's price didn't take until late May. So you're not seeing nearly as big as number as you quote, but I think the coupon dynamic is worth all of us looking at. It's something we've got to get very disciplined about. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm sorry to take this up. So that's where the lack of control hit? Because you got so much digital coupon redemption above what you had probably assumed historically? That that's hitting full, across so many products? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Teri List-Stoll,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [90]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I probably wouldn't use those words called lack of control, but it's certainly where we saw some of the activity escalation. As Tony said, as you get that stacking you do get lower efficiency, and so that's exactly what we need to tackle. 
We have the visibility to it. The magnitude of it, I guess, is what took us by surprise and we need to go after it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Keep in mind, Eric, it's subtracted from the gross revenue line. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Okay. That's all. Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [93]

John Baumgartner, Wells Fargo. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Baumgartner,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [95]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the question. Good afternoon. 
Tony, just coming back to price promotion and maybe from a different angle. We continue to hear about how promotion is being met with disappointing volume response. I think just now after the holidays we are seeing center store buy-one-get-ones, 10-for-$10s, buy the brand. We see the private label for free type of offers. 
Do you have some sense for whether we're going to see retailers begin to shoulder more of the investment in promo in the back half of the year? Is this more manufacturers just doubling down as baseline bottoms are still weak? Just your thoughts there? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [96]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think you have to look at the consumer, John. The strapped consumer is driving retailer's actions and the consumer is shopping channels for best price. It is very important to the retailer that they maintain their share of those families, frankly. That's what's driving it. 
I think all of us have to realize that it's not the long-term way to run a business. The long-term way is to innovate and offer real value to a consumer. That's where we've got to go. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Baumgartner,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [97]

Hello.

Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [100]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, Diane. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diane Geissler,  CLSA - Analyst    [101]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey. I wanted to ask about the behavior in the packaged meats business. Obviously, there's some activity there on the deal front. You took your pricing late-ish in the quarter. 
Any read on what is going on with your competitors, just in terms of do you expect them to follow you at some point? Because certainly the input costs have risen pretty aggressively, and I guess to the extent that maybe there's something going on with either private label trying to take more share. What do expect to see in terms of your volumes in the back half of the year, if the price gap remains as wide as it is today? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [102]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's not out of the bounds of the typical timing we see. Keep in mind, our price increase didn't hit until late May. Obviously, I can't comment on where they'll go with price, but there is this category is studyable over years. 
I don't necessarily believe, if you're getting at vertical integration, that it's a synergy that's going to drive disadvantage to Oscar. We've competed effectively with other vertically integrated players over time. Smithfield has long been vertically integrated and hasn't hurt the Oscar Mayer business to any disadvantage. 
ConAgra used to be vertically integrated with Armour and Swift, seen results. I think just like any other business and maybe especially in meats because protein is a trend positive wind, innovation, renovation and great marketing really matter. To us, Oscar Mayer is a jewel and we like our chances.

Diane Geissler,  CLSA - Analyst    [103]
