Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Deutsche Post DHL conference call regarding the Q1 results 2014.  (Operator Instructions).  Let me now hand the floor over to Mr. Martin Ziegenbalg.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right.  Thank you.  Good afternoon or good morning, wherever you are, for the DP DHL Q1 2014 results call.
As you've seen from our invitation, we have today with us our CFO, Larry Rosen, who is going to take you through the presentation which you can either follow on the web or have already in front of you.  And as usual, right after, we have sufficient time for Q&A.
And without further ado, I'd like to hand to hand over to you, Larry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Martin.  Good afternoon and good morning to those in the Americas.  Thanks for joining the call today.  And we'll get right into the presentation.
On page 2, we have the highlights for the quarter.  Overall, we're pleased with the results, especially given the still somewhat weak economic environment and also significant currency headwinds.  Organic top line growth was over 5% for the quarter, with all divisions contributing.  That was higher than any quarter of last year, so we were encouraged by that.
PeP EBIT was about flat, with revenue and volume growth in both letters and parcels, but also higher factor costs.  Express continued to perform very well, with excellent organic top line growth and a significant increase in the EBIT margin.  Forwarding EBIT declined due to the still difficult market conditions, especially at the beginning of the year, and also higher spend for our NFE project.
We also confirm today our guidance for 2014, which I'll review later in detail.
On to page 3, you see our P&L for the quarter.  On a reported basis, revenues and operating income or EBIT were up slightly, but as mentioned, both were significantly impacted by weaker currencies, especially in emerging markets.
Revenue and volume increases in PeP were just able to offset the factor cost increases, so EBIT was about flat for the quarter.  And DHL was also about flat, with strong increases in express offsetting an EBIT decline in global forwarding.
Corporate center costs were favorable to last year.  Financial expense increased, as last year we had the benefit of a provision release related to a tax settlement.
Taxes were down, as we now estimate a 19% effective tax rate for the full year, and we've reflected that in Q1.  If you recall last year's Q1, we were still showing a 22% rate, therefore a decrease in the quarter-over-quarter comparison.
Overall, net profit increased by around 1%.
On to page 4, free cash flow declined around EUR200m compared to Q1 of last year, but we were actually very pleased with the performance.  First, we were able to hold some of the substantial gains that we made in working capital in Q4.  And second, we were able to catch up on the CapEx spending which we booked in Q4 of last year but spent in Q1 of this year.  We now think that this phasing effect has been completed, and we won't see further effects in the remaining quarters.
On page 5, you see our net debt movement.  And as seasonally usual, our net debt increase in Q1 was mainly due to the once a year payment of more than EUR500m, this year EUR535m, for civil servant pensions, and also the working capital bounce that we usually see in Q1.
We expect net debt to further increase in Q2, as a result of the dividend payment we expect to make on May 28.  And then we expect, also as usual, a significant reduction in net debt in the second half of the year.
On page 6, I wanted to review our new reporting structure for revenues for the PeP division following the structure changes which were made effective January 1.
The global mail division has now, which you see in the middle of the page, has now been split between international letters now allocated to the sub-segment post, and parcels now allocated to ecommerce and parcel sub-segment.  And towards the bottom, on the left, you see a reminder of the parcel businesses that we've moved over from DHL, which also now become part of the ecommerce parcel sub-segment.
We've also restated both PeP and DHL for prior years, to facilitate a like-for-like comparison.
Now let's have a closer look at the division performance, and we'll start with PeP on page 7.  Revenue and volume performance was good, with benefits from an additional half working day or so, actually 0.6 as we calculate it, more volumes from the SEPA introduction, the new electronic payment methodology in the euro zone, and the price increase effective January 1.  Parcel Germany had good growth of over 5% in volume, with also a small benefit in the revenues from slightly higher prices.
In future quarters, we'll report further on the international parcel business, which in Q1 saw flat revenues and slightly lower volumes as we exited some very low value business, primarily in the US business that formerly was part of the global mail segment.
On page 8, we see the summary financial metrics for PeP.  And EBIT was very slightly up, as good volume growth was offset by higher factor costs.  In particular, one has to consider the 3.1% wage increase for postal employees in Germany which became effective August 1 last year.  Cash flow performance was good, as improvements from previous quarters on working capital levels could be sustained.
And over to DHL, starting with express on page 9.  The very strong performance of express continued in Q1, highlighted by continued high single digit volume growth in TDI and a strong performance in all regions.  For the first time in several years, revenues per day increased faster than shipments per day, reflecting, among other things, our successful and active yield management.
Favorable scale effects, both in the air and on the ground, led to a strong margin performance again in Q1, with an EBIT margin of 9.6%, a full 1 percentage point higher than Q1 of last year.
And on to page 10, revenue growth was constrained by significant currency headwind and also the small divestiture of our Romanian domestic business in Q1 of last year.  Organic revenue growth was at a very healthy 8.1%, and EBIT grew even faster, with a 14.1% increase over last year.  And excluding the Cargus, or the Romanian business sale gain, the increase would have been around 20%.
Cash flow performance was also very good, as improved working capital metrics could be maintained in Q1.  CapEx had its usual slow start for the year, but as in previous years I expect the pace to now pick up in following quarters.
Now turning to global forwarding and freight, on page 11, the first quarter was actually an improvement over previous quarters for the industry, with volume growth in both air freight and ocean freight.  In air freight, our mix of customers and sectors led to a flat growth compared to last year, though we saw significant positive improvement towards the end of the quarter.  Ocean freight growth was around 5%, what we estimate around what the industry growth rate was, and also saw strengthening towards the end of the quarter.
The NFE implementation is proceeding well and on plan and, as expected, spending increased accordingly.
On page 12, continuing with forwarding and freight, the division saw organic revenue growth of 2.5% for the quarter.  Gross profit margins continued to be at historically low levels, reflecting intensive competition and active transport industry capacity management in what is still a low growth volume environment.  This is affecting us particularly in air freight.
EBIT was significantly down in the quarter, though we saw meaningful improvement towards the end of the quarter.  Primary drivers of the decrease were the significant increase in NFE spend as well as the mentioned low historical GP levels, especially in air freight.  Operating cash flow declined as working capital bounced back from very lower yearend levels.
On page 13, we begin on the supply chain division, which had a very good quarter for organic top line growth, around 6.7%, and that reflected the significant impact of both currency effects and several divestitures that we did in the course of 2013.  Expansion in selected emerging markets continued to make good progress.
New business signings were a bit lower in Q1, reflecting the very high level of signings in previous quarters.  However, in the last 12 months, new business signings remained well over EUR1b for the year.
On page 14, you see that supply chain EBIT was about flat compared to Q1 of last year, reflecting still weak economic conditions in Central Europe and high startup costs for some of the new contracts that we recently signed.  Cash flow was also down, reflecting an increase in working capital levels, and CapEx increased to support the high level of recent new business signings.
So, on page 15, we have another look at our guidance for the year, and we confirm the forecast which was announced on March 12.  Group EBIT should be between EUR2.9b and EUR3.1b.  PeP EBIT is expected to be around EUR1.2b.  DHL divisions collectively should contribute EUR2.1b to EUR2.3b, and corporate center costs are expected to be below EUR400m for the year.
Free cash flow is again expected to cover the dividend we expect to pay, with shareholder approval of our recommendation at the end of May.  The tax rate estimate also reflected in Q1 is 19% for the full year, down from our original estimate of 20%.  And following a slow start in Q1, we still expect CapEx to be around EUR1.9b for the full year.
And wrapping up on page 16, we were overall pleased with the Q1 performance, with good volume and revenue trends and positive momentum towards the end of the quarter.  Express continued its excellent performance.
And we now focus intensively on our strategy 2015 and strategy 2020 objectives, including further leverage and scale effects, focus on growth in emerging markets, the complete implementation of NFE for global forwarding, and last but not least, expansion of ecommerce and parcel business both in Germany and internationally.
And finally, again, we confirm the 2014 guidance as just described.
So thank you for your attention, and we would be happy now to answer your questions.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions).  Stephen Furlong, Davy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen Furlong,  Davy - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, Larry.  Could you just talk about yields?  There's different performances in the express and the forwarding business.  I know it's different, but just what's going on in terms of the very strong revenue per day and the yield management there?  Is it the market position or just the market's improved a bit so you can do that?
And then secondly, on the forwarding, is it to do with freight rates or just generally the GP per unit timing in the quarter is just very difficult with sluggish volumes?  That would be great.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think it's a completely different story in the two industries.  In express, you know that the industry, including us, has GRIs, general rate increases, every year, usually starting in January.  This year, we've been very active in making sure that we implement as much of the announced GRI as possible.  There also are some mix effects, some increase in average weight per shipment, which is influencing the revenue per day.  So there's a few things going on, but overall the situation on yields in express is slightly positive.
In forwarding and freight, you have to kind of look at both sides, the buy and the sell side.  The still overall pretty weak economy or weak growth environment and intensive competitive situation in the industry means that buyers, in particular big buyers, of our services have a fair amount of leverage.
On the other hand, in particular in air freight, we've seen a reduction in pure cargo capacity, even if that's been offset somewhat by an increase in commercial airliner capacity, but still buying rates for us for air freight capacity have stayed pretty firm.  So that's all led to a decline in overall GP levels in air freight, and we think that's the case for the industry.  it certainly is the case for us.
And it's the same thing in ocean freight, but to a little less of an extent than it is for air freight, and we've seen better volume development as well in ocean freight.  So I think it's really two completely different situations in the two industries.

Hi, Andy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andy Chu,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi there, Larry, Martin.  Three questions from me, please.  Larry, I wondered if you could give us some sort of numbers or flavor around what you alluded to in your presentation about better run rates within global forwarding towards the end of the quarter.  Are you back into positive year-on-year growth in terms of EBIT?
Second question, linked to that, I understand, I think, that the year-on-year uplift in NFE costs has been pretty dramatic in Q1.  Could you make some comment around that, please, if possible?
And then my third question is, within the PeP division and parcels, would you be able to give us, please, a little bit more information around the parcel investment?  I'm not sure you'll be able to quantify that, but how should we think about the -- when that investment, how that phases out over the rest of the year, please?  Thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Yes.  So I won't talk about EBIT on an individual month basis, but I will say that we're still seeing somewhat negative growth, in particular in air freight, right at the beginning of the year and it picked up to a positive level toward the end of the quarter.  There were some weather influences, in particular in North America, at the beginning of the year which we think slowed down volume growth a bit in addition to the overall kind of weak industry growth.  And we saw really some positive momentum going towards the end of the quarter in terms of volumes.
So, for year-over-year NFE cost evolution, what I can say is that the EBIT decline that we had, somewhat less than half of that decline is due to the increase in NFE spending.  More detail than that I think I don't want to give for competitive reasons, but to give you an orientation as to what it meant in Q1, that's what it was.
So, in terms of the parcel investment, that's something that's ongoing.  So it's probably the single biggest -- or not probably, it is the single biggest project in terms of CapEx for the mail division, and it's one that's going to continue for some time.  So I think the spending for this year and next year on that project, if we want to call it that, is going to continue at a relatively high level.

David Ross, Stifel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus & Co. - Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  Good afternoon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, David.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus & Co. - Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello.  The first question is on DHL global forwarding, specifically on the air freight side.  It looks as if DHL is losing market share.  Is this on purpose, as you're trying to rationalize the network and maybe get better yields, or is there something going on in the market where a competitor is just coming in and undercutting price?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, we think you're right.  Our growth has definitely been behind the industry for several quarters.  That continued also in Q1.  It has partly to do with our customer and sector mix.  I think we were much more reliant or much more exposed to sectors which have declined the most, like the tech sector and the engineering and manufacturing sectors.  So that was one reason.  And then we've had in the past the so-called selective strategy of rejecting to take on loss making or very low margin business.
I think both of those trends are moderating, maybe not over.  We still will not take on what for sure will be loss making business.  But I think we've become a bit more aggressive at defending share and I think the sector trend has pretty much run its course, so that we think we're going to be in a much better position now in the future to hold share at least, as opposed to losing share every quarter as we've done for the last few quarters.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus & Co. - Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then, real quick on the express side, a very nice EBIT improvement.  Can you comment a little bit more about how you were able to show a decline in purchased goods and services as revenues increased?  I don't know if there is any accounting reallocation, moving some of the purchased goods into the net other operating, or what was going on there, but it seemed to be good expense management.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  I think you have to be careful about looking at those figures because they're so heavily impacted by currency movements, and currency mix on top line can be different from currency mix on the purchased goods line.  So I don't think you should draw too much of a conclusion from that.
I think what's important to take away for express is that the very good volume and revenue growth that we've been able to achieve is giving us some quite good scale effects, both in air operations and also ground operations, and that is the primary driver of the margin increases and EBIT increase that we've seen in express.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus & Co. - Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [22]

Christopher Combe, JPMorgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Combe,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, guys.  Just a follow up on forwarding first.  I think in the recent past you've mentioned that you're happier to take on, become a bit more aggressive, as you just reiterated.  Was any of that evident already in the first quarter, so that we're actually seeing some replacement volume at a lower GP?  And if so, how much GP are you willing to sacrifice, on average, to claw back share, and does that have implications for working capital as well?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I think a couple of things are going on.  One is that there's probably less differentiation now that the business has been kind of in not great shape for a number of quarters for the whole industry and also for us, so there's not a huge differentiation in margins across the different business opportunities.  So what was a better reason to be selective a few quarters ago has become really less important.
So the other thing is that the volume growth is certainly improving in the business, and so there's just more opportunity to get new business than there was a few quarters ago.  I think in the first half of last year, volume growth for the whole industry in air freight was negative.  It was kind of flattish in the second half, maybe slightly up.  And we saw a better picture overall in Q1, with again increasing momentum toward the end of quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Combe,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  And very quickly on express, what should we read into -- or what can you say about the trade down trend in light of 1.5% TDI price/mix progress?
And also, bigger picture, what does this mean for a secular versus cyclical development?  We see some of your US competition, at least in the domestic market, addressing the pricing formula towards volume metric.  Would that seem foolish now that average weight per shipment is going up?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  The trade down phenomena that some of our competitors are talking about is something that we haven't really experienced.  Our TDI business is all kind of premium time critical business and we have not seen a trade down effect.  On the contrary, we think that we've been gaining share and have made very good progress on volume growth in TDI.  And I think the secular versus cyclical matter is more confined to the domestic US market at this point than to the international TDI market.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Combe,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great.  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello.  Good afternoon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, Damian.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi there.  Three questions, if I can.  First of all, on the supply chain, could you tell us what the balance is between obviously contract growth but then subsequent startup costs versus a slightly lower growth business and margin?  Where is the balance and how you're thinking about that?  And in particular, how do you think about that versus the gestation period for the new work you announced last year to come online and have those startup costs?
If I give you them all at once, secondly, in express, that was a really impressive 50% plus incremental margin.  The one thing I'm interested is, given the unit cost reduction you have achieved, albeit it with what's happening with FX, how much momentum is there left in that unit cost reduction that we've seen in express over the last few quarters?  Is there a natural point where that runs out, or how much longer can that go for?
And then, very finally, just looking at the interim report, it looks like the deferred tax assets have crept up a bit, so I assume a little bit more of the unrecognized tax losses have been activated.  How many unrecognized tax losses are now left in the Group which could be recognizable if profit growth continued to improve?  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  So let me come back to your first question.  I think the life blood of the supply chain business for us is our ability to attract new contracts which enrich the overall contract mix that we have, so higher margin, higher value-added contracts, and that's exactly what we've been doing.  We would probably say that we would never forgo taking on new business so that we avoid the startup costs.
Startup costs are just part of the game in the supply chain business.  We point them out in Q1 because they were maybe just a little bit unusually high, higher than usual.  But overall, it's exactly what we are trying to do, is attract new higher margin business so as to -- and what we think of as enriching the overall mix.  So that's absolutely the critical success factor for us in supply chain.
And your question on express, how much scale effects are remaining, and I would say that there is no natural limit, that if we are able to achieve the very favorable top line performance in revenues and in volumes in core TDI business as we have done in the last couple of years and several quarters, we should continue to see very favorable scale effects.
Of course, we do have to invest and will get at some point a bit of an uptick in depreciation expense, but that will be small in comparison to the overall scale effects that we get from really good top line growth.  So that's what's really important there.
DTA, you're right; we've made a small adjustment in terms of activating additional loss carry forwards.  In total, we have probably about EUR3b of loss carry forwards remaining that could be activated if we are able to justify it with our actual and forecast performance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.  And can I just ask quickly, the startup costs, could you give us some idea, in the supply chain, what the difference year on year of those was and how that could progress over the year, if you have any visibility on that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian, I could tell you but I think I would refrain from doing so, because our competitors are aware of which contracts we are starting up at this point, which new contracts we've won.  And if I told you that, they'd have some idea about the startup costs for each one, which we for competitive reasons would prefer not to disclose.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Understood.  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [38]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Edridge,  UBS - Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  Hi there.  Just a couple of questions from myself.  Firstly, just in terms of the revenue progression in express, I was just wondering if you could just talk a little bit about it.  There seems to have been a bit of a slowdown sequentially in the European business and I was just wondering if that's just due to the restatements or something similar, or whether there has been a slowdown there, whether you could just discuss that a bit.
And the second thing is I just wanted to clarify something that is on page 24 in the report, just in terms of the creditworthiness and also the operating cash flow progression.  It's just I think you're saying that the FFO to debt performance you're expecting to be flat for the full year, whereas the operational cash flow performance you expect to be better, and I was just wondering if you could just reconcile those two for me.  Am I missing out on something there?  Thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Yes, we had a slightly slower quarter in Europe in terms of volume growth, but I don't think I would really read too much into that.  It kind of goes together with the active yield management and being insistent on putting through the GRIs that we have announced and implemented at the beginning of the year.  But still, 3.7%, we think that was at least what the industry growth was, so we were either at or maybe somewhat above industry growth also in Europe.
In terms of the FFO to debt and the forecast of being flat for the year, I think that's probably a very rough estimate.  It has to do with some of the timing effects that we had at the end of last year.  We talked about the very strong cash flow performance coming from working capital reduction, but in particular the timing differences between the booking of capital expenditures and spending, where we booked the CapEx last year but the spending is taking place this year.
So, even though we are quite confident that we are going to achieve our guidance of generating more free cash flow than we need to pay the dividend of a little bit less than EUR1b, we still do have those timing effects.  And I think I mentioned on the March 12 call that we estimate that there were about EUR300m to EUR400m of cash flow that we booked last year, but is going to reverse this year.  So we still think that's the case, and that's what's behind that rough forecast.

Johannes Braun,  Commerzbank - Analyst    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  Hi.  Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.  Just one left, actually, on the express.  Obviously, that was a very strong performance in Q1, with a margin of 9.6%.  Given your guidance is 10% for 2015, is there upside pressure on the guidance?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I don't want to make a separate or individual margin forecast for express, but as you can see, we are making excellent progress.  We have given a forecast that margins in 2015 would be 10% or above, and we stick to that forecast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johannes Braun,  Commerzbank - Analyst    [47]

Good afternoon.  Basically, a lot of questions have been answered already, but I'm still struggling to get my head around the extent of the slump in earnings there, so two questions around that.  What corrective actions are you taking to stabilize performance going forward?
And secondly, your 2015 targets also said you would grow earnings in forwarding by 13% to 15% per year from 2010 basis.  Is that still on?  And should we look at that like earnings going down this year and up next year, or stable this year going up next year, or how do you look at 2015 from today's perspective on the forwarding side?  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I think that forwarding we are actually doing quite a lot to first stabilize, as you say, but also improve performance also going into next year, and we are confident that we can do that.  Certainly, one of the main areas that we are looking at is the entire overhead cost area.  We have already achieved some improvements in conversion.  Once you take out the NFE effects, we expect to continue to be able to do that, and also to accelerate that trend with the benefits that we expect to get from the new IT environment.  So that's the primary area that we are looking at.
Another is the customer and sector mix.  We are looking at focusing a bit more on SMEs, and we think that some of those customer segments can be more profitable than the very large customers that the forwarding business has been quite dependent on for some time.  So I would say those are the main areas that we are looking at for improving performance.

Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does that answer your question?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Are you happy with that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tobias Sittig,  MainFirst Bank - Analyst    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  Part one, yes.  The 2015 target was the second part of the question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2015 target.  So I think we stick with -- we confirm and stick with the EUR2.6b to EUR2.8b of EBIT for DHL in total, and that still does represent 13% to 15%.  I think I would refrain from giving individual forecasts for individual divisions at this point and rather stick with the total target for DHL.

Okay.  Thank you

Actually, I have two questions.  Thank you very much.  First question is on sea freight, which you haven't said too much about, I don't think.  Sea freight gross profit trends, they seem to be worse in the industry than air freight, because of the excess capacity in the sea freight business.  What were your results in the first quarter in sea freight, and do you see the same trends -- pressure on gross margins there?
And the second question was how sustainable do you think the improvement in air freight that you saw in March is, going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  So sea freight gross profit margins have been under some pressure too.  They are near to historical low levels, we think, for the industry and for us.  And due to the same or similar set of factors that I talked about with air freight, kind of a weak negotiating situation vis-a-vis large buyers of forwarding services and relatively a lot of discipline on the part of sea freight carriers, even though, as you correctly say, there is a substantial amount of excess capacity also in sea freight.
So we think the prospects are good, that we'll at least come back toward historical margin levels, especially in sea freight.  When exactly we might do that, I won't give you an exact prediction.
Does that answer your question?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Campbell,  Thompson Davis & Co - Analyst    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, thank you.  And then the question about the sustainability of the air freight improvement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, we think it's sustainable.  I think we are getting some small pickup in overall economic activity in the world and also trade volumes, and air freight is probably picking up as a result of that.  I also think the structural changes that we've seen in the last couple of years and quarters has pretty much run its course, and so we are not going to get as much of a negative headwind from those structural trends as we did in the last couple of years.

Good afternoon, everyone.  Two questions from my side.  The first is actually in the PeP division, where you're, I believe, now just reporting from the mail volume perspective a kind of total number which increased, I believe, 2% in the quarter.  Understand that there is an element of working day effect there, but given you don't provide a detailed breakdown on the volumes, would you be able to share perhaps what the broad growth rates were in the traditional German mail business versus the new elements of the divisional business that you've added into that PeP division, just to understand what the more traditional mail volumes have evolved over the quarter?
And my second question is, just to come back quickly on express, I think each of your geographic regions reported what appears to be some level of small price increase, with the exception of the Middle East, Africa region.  Could you perhaps explain why the price increases were not so successful in that region?  Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  So, in the PeP division and the letter segment, we had pretty much a similar trend in the main segments, that being mail communication and dialogue marketing, dialogue marketing in particular because of additional volume from the SEPA implementation.  And mail communication was also benefiting on the revenue side from the price increase, the stamp price increase.  There was also a couple of regional elections, which also helped the volumes marginally.
But the growth rates in those couple of segments were not too much different than the overall growth rate for the whole what now we call the post sub-segment.
So, yes, express pricing and the Middle East, Africa, I don't think there was a very different approach at all.  It may be that some mix effects have affected some regions more than others.  So I wouldn't read anything into that differentiation in one single quarter at this point.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Penny Butcher,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [74]

Okay.  That's great.  Thanks a lot, Larry.

Robert Joynson,  Macquarie - Analyst    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, Larry.  Good afternoon, Martin.  I've got three questions remaining, if I may.  I'll give them all to you at the same time.  The first question is just on the supply chain division and the seasonality within that business.  Just looking at the numbers, if you strip out the EUR30m of one-offs that we saw in Q4, basically we're seeing the underlying EBIT increase from EUR100m in Q3 of last year up to EUR148m in Q4 and then back down to EUR84m in Q1.
Now, in previous years we haven't seen Q4 be so strong relative to the other quarters, so I was just wondering if you could tell us whether the seasonality in the supply chain business is now greater than it has been in the past, or if not what the specific reasons were for Q4 being so strong relative to the other quarters.  So that's the first question.
The second question, just on the forwarding business, it seems there was quite a big increase in working capital between Q4 and Q1.  Could you just maybe provide some feedback on the extent to which that was seasonal as opposed to business specific, please?
And then the final question, just a quick one following on from Penny's before, just regarding the disclosure on the mail volumes.  Obviously, only the total mail volumes were reported during the current quarter, but I understand that the plan is to possibly provide a more detailed breakdown of volumes, going forward.  So could you just provide some clarity on that, if possible?  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  So, I think there is some seasonality in the supply chain business.  We had quite a good Q4.  But I'm not sure that I would say that there has been an increase in seasonality since a few years ago.  It's something I would have to take a closer look at, but I think it's probably not the case.
So let me go to your third question, because I'm going to ask you to repeat your second one because I didn't get it all.  So, in terms of the disclosure of mail volumes by sub-segment, it's something that we hadn't planned to do but we'll reconsider, given that just in this call we've had two questions about it.  So let us take it on board and think about whether we want to give some more details there.
I think we are kind of settling on how we want to present the division overall for the future, so I kind of referred to that when I talked about the division performance.  So let us take that on board and think about it, and we'll come back to you next time and maybe have a better or expanded disclosure already in Q2.
So, maybe you could repeat your second question, because I didn't get the whole thing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Joynson,  Macquarie - Analyst    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, of course.  It was just a question on the forwarding and freight business.  It seems that there was quite a large increase in working capital between Q4 and Q1, so I was just wondering if you could provide some color on the extent to which that working capital increase was seasonal as opposed to driven by specific underlying business issues.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  That is actually a usual seasonal effect that we see in particular in the forwarding business, as Q4 is typically the very high volume quarter and Q1 tends to be a low volume quarter.  So I would say it's more seasonal effects than anything else.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Joynson,  Macquarie - Analyst    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would it be fair to say, though, that it was worse this year than in previous years?  I am just looking at the operating cash flow, which was obviously EUR97m negative this year.  In Q1 of last year, it was EUR71m positive, so it seems like there was some change beyond the seasonal factors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  It also has to do with the EBIT progression, so we had only about half the EBIT in Q1 this year than we did last year, so that certainly was a factor in that overall trend.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Joynson,  Macquarie - Analyst    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Very helpful.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Bye-bye.

Hi, Robin

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robin Byde,  Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [90]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi there.  Just two questions from me.  Firstly, how negative is the Russia/Ukraine situation for express and the other divisions?
And then secondly, a slightly different question, just on the dividend payment.  Obviously, your annual dividend payment is coming up at the end of the month.  Have you and the Board given any more thought to paying an interim dividend to smooth out the income?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, the Russia/Ukraine situation, crisis if you want to call it that, Ukraine crisis, has not had any noticeable effect on any of our businesses to date.  Certainly, the devaluation of the ruble, also a fairly big devaluation in Q1 and continuing into Q2 compared to the previous year levels, will have some small effect.  But the operating business itself, in terms of volumes and revenues and operations, has not been affected.
So, the dividend payment, we continue to consider other models than the annual dividend.  So far, mainly due to German corporate governance where the once a year shareholders' meeting approves the dividend, we haven't yet -- we haven't seriously thought about a change to that.  But we think about the different options on the table and analyze the pros and cons.  Technically it's possible, but it's something we haven't yet decided to do.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robin Byde,  Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  That's clear.  Thanks very much.

Neil Glynn,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [96]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, Larry and Martin.  I'm nearly all out, but just a couple of follow ups, if I could.  The first one, on the supply chain division, Larry, you obviously mentioned that the last 12-month new order number is very strong, but I just wanted to double check.  Is the slowdown on new orders into the first quarter continuing into the second, or are we back to business as usual?
And then, on the PeP division, following on from Penny's question with respect to the volume performance, can you confirm, should we expect a decline in core mail volumes into the second quarter going forward, as the exceptionals in the first quarter don't repeat?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [97]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, let me take the second question first.  So, fortunately for us, the European Union or the euro zone was a little bit late in implementing the SEPA change, or has delayed it from what originally was February 1 to now, I think, August 1, so it's been delayed by around six months.  So that gives us hope that we may see some additional benefit from that in Q2 and maybe even a bit of Q3.
So that's one exceptional that I would expect to continue now for at least the next few months.  And I think, in terms of other exceptionals, there are no others that I am aware of.
So, the slowdown that we had in new business signings in Q1, I definitely would not read too much into that at all.  I would look at the last number of quarters of new signings.  One reason that you might have a slow quarter is because you had such strong quarters in a couple of previous quarters, and it's just the timing of when the negotiations come to a conclusion.
So, without saying anything about Q2, I'll just say that we are confident as ever that we are going to be able to win really attractive new business.  As I said before, it's really the life blood of the business and is the key to allow us to improve overall performance, which we intend to do.  So we are optimistic about our ability to continue to win high levels of new business.
