Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2013. 
Joining me on the podium today are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Office, and Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. 
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available to a broader audience via a webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. 
I'll begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the fourth quarter and the full year of 2013 for the Corporation and highlights for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Alex will comment on the 2013 results and provide a strategic outlook for the Company. 
Dominic will then provide some additional commentary on financial results and guidance for 2014. We will then open the meeting to your questions. We expect the meeting to conclude at approximately 10:15. 
Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is a schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. Also, please note the presentation that accompanies today's remarks is available on our website. 
Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2012 identifies certain factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the Company and online. 
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. 
A number of the compounds and products discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies. This slide acknowledges those relationships. 
Now I would like to review our results for the fourth quarter of 2013. If you would refer to your copy of the press release, let's begin with the schedule titled Supplementary Sales Data by Geographic Area. 
Worldwide sales to customers were $18.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2013, up 4.5% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. On an operational basis, sales were up 6.3%, and currency had a negative impact of 1.8%. 
In the US, sales were up 7.4%. In regions outside the US, our operational growth was 5.6%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 3.2%. 
Asia-Pacific, Africa region grew 7% operationally. Both Europe and the Western Hemisphere, excluding the US, grew by 4.8% operationally. The success of new product launches made strong contributions to the results in all regions. 
If you'll now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings, net earnings were $3.5 billion, up 37.1% compared with the 2012 results. Earnings per share were $1.23 versus $0.91 a year ago. 
Please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items. As referenced in the accompanying table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2013 fourth-quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a net charge of $42 million for after-tax special items. Fourth-quarter 2012 net earnings included a net charge of $809 million for after-tax special items. 
[Dominic will] discuss special items in his remarks. Excluding these special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $3.6 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $1.24, representing increases of 5.5% and 4.2% respectively, as compared to the same period in 2012. 
I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to earnings before we move on to the segment highlights. For the fourth quarter of 2013, cost of goods sold at 32.5% was 170 basis points less than the same period last year. In the prior year, we recorded an inventory step-up charge related to the Synthes acquisition that increased cost of goods sold by 130 basis points. This charge was treated as a special item. 
Excluding the impact of this prior-year inventory step-up charge, cost of goods sold was 40 basis points lower than fourth quarter 2012, primarily due to positive mix, lower cost associated with strong volume growth in our Pharmaceutical business, and cost improvement initiatives across many of our businesses. This was partially offset by costs associated with the agreement with Vertex for Incivo, related to royalties, that was announced in the fourth quarter; inventory adjustments; and the impact of the Medical Device Excise Tax. 
Fourth-quarter selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 32.2% of sales, in line with the fourth quarter of 2012. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 13.1%, down 20 basis points due to timing of milestone payments in the Pharmaceuticals business. Interest expense, net of interest income, of $116 million was up $27 million versus the fourth quarter of 2012, due in part to a higher average debt level. 
Other expense net of other income was $868 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to $319 million in the same period last year. Excluding special items, other expense net of other income of $47 million compares to $420 million of other income net of other expense. 2012 included a higher level of gains on divestitures. 
Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 8.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to 18% in the same period last year. Dominic will provide some commentary on taxes in his remarks. 
Now turning to the consolidated statement of earnings for the full year of 2013. Consolidated sales to customers for the year of 2013 were $71.3 billion, an increase of 6.1% as compared to the same period a year ago. 
On an annual basis, sales grew 7.7% operationally, and currency had a negative the impact of 1.6%. Synthes, net of the impact of the divestiture of the legacy DePuy trauma business, contributed 2.5 points to the worldwide operational sales growth. 
On the consolidated statement of earnings, I'd like to draw your attention to the boxed section. For the year, 2013 adjusted net earnings were $15.9 billion, and adjusted earnings per share were $5.52, up 10.7% and 8.2% respectively versus the 2012 results. 
Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule highlighting key products or businesses for the fourth quarter of 2013. I'll begin with the Consumer segment. 
Worldwide Consumer segment sales for the fourth quarter of 2013, up $3.8 billion, increased 2.8% as compared to the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 4.4% while the impact of currency was negative 1.6%. 
US sales were up 5%, while International sales grew 4.1% on an operational basis. Excluding the impact of divestitures, net of acquisitions, operational growth was approximately 6%, driven by strong US growth of nearly 10%. 
Baby care products increased on an operational basis by 6.2% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Strong operational growth of 7.1% outside the US drove the results, due to double-digit growth for hair care and baby cleansers, complemented by the impact of the Elsker products acquired earlier this year. 
Sales in the oral care business increased 2.3% operationally. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of the manual toothbrushes in North America, fourth-quarter operational sales grew approximately 4.5%, led by strong growth of 8.6% outside the US, with LISTERINE new product launches and new marketing campaigns. 
For the fourth quarter of 2013, sales for OTC pharmaceuticals increased 6.6% on an operational basis, compared to the same period in 2012. US sales were up 21.6%, driven by strong growth in analgesics and other key brands as we continue to make progress in returning a reliable supply of products to the marketplace. 
Our skin care business grew 9.5% on an operational basis in the fourth quarter of 2013. Very strong results for NEUTROGENA and Debao, with new product launches supported by robust marketing campaigns, drove results in the quarter. 
Women's health declined 11.5% on an operational basis due primarily to the impact of the divestiture of the North America sanitary protection business. Wound care other sales increased 2.6% on an operational basis due to strong growth for BAND-AID brand. 
That completes our review of the Consumer segment and I'll now review highlights for our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide net sales for the fourth quarter of $7.3 billion increased 11.8% versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 13.1%, with a negative currency impact of 1.3%. Sales in the US increased 17.9%, while sales outside the US increased on an operational basis by 9%. 
Now reviewing sales for major therapeutic areas. Immunology products grew 22.6% operationally, with sales in the US up 19.2%, and sales outside the US up 31.9% operationally. 
Earlier this year, the Company made certain supply chain changes for REMICADE, resulting in sales to distributors, previously recorded as US export sales, now being recorded as international sales. Adjusting the base to reflect this impact, the fourth-quarter 2013 US immunology growth was approximately 26%, and operational growth outside the US was approximately 14%. 
In the US, REMICADE, excluding export sales, was up 12.7%, SIMPONI was up 55.6%, and STELARA was up 67.7%. Results were driven by strong market growth, complemented by increased market share for both STELARA and SIMPONI, with new indications and formulations introduced in 2013. With the strength of our portfolio, we continue to be the US market leader in immunology. 
REMICADE outside the US, adjusted for the supply chain change [that was] just mentioned, was up approximately 2% operationally, with strong growth in Canada partially offset by the lower sales in Latin America due to pricing pressure and timing of shipments. STELARA made significant contributions to growth outside the US due to market share gains and market growth across the major regions, while SIMPONI's strong growth was due to increased shipments to our distribution partner and strong growth in Japan and other markets. 
Sales of infectious disease products increased 9.9% on an operational basis. INCIVO declined 23.6% on an operational basis, reflecting lower sales in Europe, impacted by a combination of patient warehousing and patient enrollment in clinical trials in certain countries, partially offset by strong sales in other countries as we obtained reimbursements. 
PREZISTA grew 30.3% on an operational basis due to continued momentum in market share growth in the major markets, while INTELENCE grew 12.7% operationally due to double-digit growth in Europe. The combined sales of [COMPLERA] and EDURANT also contributed to the results, as did sales of our newly-launched Hepatitis C product, called OLYSIO in the US and SOVRIAD in Japan. 
Neuroscience product sales increased 0.7% operationally and were impacted negatively by generic competition. US growth was 1.7% and sales outside the US were flat on an operational basis. The long-acting injectable anti-psychotics RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION achieved operational growth of approximately 15% due to an increase in combined market share. 
Sales of oncology products increased 37.4% on an operational basis, primarily due to the strong results for ZYTIGA. In the quarter, ZYTIGA achieved operational sales growth of over 85%, with similar results both in and outside the US. 
In the US, a very strong market growth of over 18% and increased market share in the combined metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer market drove results. ZYTIGA has captured nearly 34% of that market. 
Additional country roll-outs and the expansion of the label to chemo-naive patients drove the strong results outside the US. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 80 countries. 
VELCADE sales increased 7.4% on an operational basis. Strong performance in patient share in the front-line setting and the launch of the subcutaneous version continue to drive sales growth, partially offset by the timing of tender business in the fourth quarter of 2012, as we discussed last year. 
Other oncology sales increased due to CAELYX sales. Regarding DOXIL/CAELYX, ensuring a sufficient supply for physicians and/or patients remains our urgent priority. In the US, we are experiencing a supply outage of DOXIL due to issues at our third-party manufacturer. 
We continue our discussions with the FDA regarding short-term plans and other long-term options for manufacturing. The FDA has approved a generic doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection, which is currently available for patients. 
In Europe, we are continuing to supply CAELYX. In the third quarter of 2013, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, approved manufacturing of CAELYX from its ultimate supplier as part of our long-term transition to new manufacturers. 
Other Pharmaceutical products increased 0.5% on an operational basis, with strong results for XARELTO and INVOKANA, partially offset by lower sales for ACIPHEX. XARELTO nearly tripled compared with the same quarter last year and grew 10% on a sequential basis, reaching over 38% of the new-to-brand scripts, or NBRx, in cardiology in December, surpassing Warfarin by over 7 points. Total prescription share in the broader anti-coagulant market grew 1.5 points on a sequential basis to 10.5%. 
INVOKANA contributed 2 points to the US Pharmaceutical growth rate, and at the end of the quarter, achieved 19% NBRx with endocrinologists, within the defined market of Type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin. INVOKANA holds the number one position for branded non-insulin NBRx in that market. 
Some updates of note for our Pharmaceuticals business. During the quarter, the FDA granted approval of OLYSIO simeprevir for combination treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Simeprevir was also approved in Japan and Canada. In Japan, it is marketed SOVRIAD and in Canada as GALEXOS. 
The FDA also approved IMBRUVICA to treat mantel cell lymphoma, MCL, for patients who received at least one prior treatment. The European Commission approved INVOKANA for the treatment of adults with Type 2 diabetes and we expect INVOKANA to be available in Germany and the UK this quarter. 
A complete response letter, or CRL, was received from the FDA regarding the fixed-dose combination of canagliflozin and immediate release metformin to treat adults with Type 2 diabetes. The CRL requests additional information to support the comparability of twice daily dosing and the once daily of canagliflozin as a single agent. We believe we can supply this information based on available clinical data. 
In addition, SIRTURO received a positive opinion from the European CHMC for use as part of combination therapy to treat adults with pulmonary multi-drug resistant tuberculosis. A marketing application was submitted to the European Medicines Agency for ibrutinib for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, or relapsed or refractory MCL. 
The DLA for Siltuximab received a priority review designation in the US. And Esketamine was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for treatment-resistant depression. 
Last week the FDA Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee voted against the approval of the use of XARELTO in patients with acute coronary syndrome. We will work with the FDA to address the questions raised. 
In addition, the rights for DORIBAX are returning to Shionogi earlier this year and the US exclusivity period for ACIPHEX expired in the fourth quarter, and the co-promotion agreement with Eisai was terminated. Eisai will continue to market and produce ACIPHEX in the US. The co-promotion agreements in certain international countries were also terminated. 
That completes the review of the Pharmaceutical segment. I'll now review the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment results. 
Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment sales of $7.3 billion decreased 1% versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 1.5%, with a negative currency impact of 2.5%. 
Sales in the US declined 1.4%, while sales outside the US increased on an operational basis by 3.7%. Adjusted for divestitures and exits from certain businesses, underlying operational growth was approximately 2%. 
Starting with cardiovascular care, sales were up 8.3% operationally, with the US up 12.9%, and sales outside the US up 5.7%, operationally. Biosense Webster achieved worldwide operational growth of over 13% in the quarter. The success of a number of catheter launches and market expansions made strong contributions to the results. 
Diabetes care declined 11.9% on an operational basis in the fourth quarter of 2013, with the US business down 25.8%, due to the impact of lower price, primarily related to competitive bidding. The business outside the US was flat operationally with increased sales related to the launch of Animas Vibe, offset by lower sales of meters and strips. 
The diagnostics business declined 9.4% on an operational basis, impacted by the divestiture of the Therakos business, while infection prevention increased 5% on an operational basis, with similar results both in and outside the United States. 
Orthopaedics sales were up 4.2% on an operational basis, when compared to the same period in 2012, with the US up 4.9%, and sales outside the US up 3.5% on an operational basis. Strong growth for knees and hips drove results this quarter, partially offset by slower sales for spine products. Growth was positively impacted by trauma results versus the fourth quarter last year. 
Operationally, hips were up 5% worldwide, driven by 8% growth in the US, due to strong results in primary stem platform sales, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Hips outside the US were up 2% on an operational basis. 
Knees worldwide increased 8% on an operational basis, with 9% growth in the US and 6% operational growth outside the US. The successful launch of the ATTUNE fixed bearing knee drove the results, partially offset by pricing pressure. 
Trauma was up 7% on an operational basis, with the US up 10%. Results in the fourth quarter last year were impacted by a nail recall. 
Outside the US, sales were up 4% operationally, driven by growth in Asia-Pacific, with new product launches. Worldwide spine was down 2% on an operational basis, with US down approximately 5%, impacted by pricing pressure, the continued softness in the market, as well as the disruption in the commercial sales organization as we integrate the businesses. Outside the US, sales were up approximately 2% operationally due to growth in Asia-Pacific. 
Specialty surgery operational growth was 6.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013. US sales were up 1.8%, and sales outside the US were up 10.7% on an operational basis. International sales of energy products and strong sales of biosurgical products were the major contributors to growth, complemented by US growth for market expansion for Acclarent products. 
Surgical care worldwide sales were up 1% on an operational basis, with the US down 3.1% and sales outside the US up 3.4% operationally. US sales were impacted by lower sales of women's health and mechanical products. Outside the US, suture sales and strong demand for EndoCutter products with the ECHELON FLEX-powered ENDOPATH Stapler were the important drivers of growth. 
Rounding out the review of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment, our vision care business achieved operational sales growth of 2.6% in the fourth quarter, with the US down 0.4% and sales outside the US up 4% operationally. Growth was driven by daily lenses and astigmatism lenses, partially offset by lower sales of reusable lenses in the US. 
That completes highlights for the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter of 2013. It is now my pleasure to turn the meeting over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?

Alex Gorsky,  Johnson & Johnson - Chairman & CEO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Well, thank you very much, Louise. 
I'd like to welcome all of you [who are] participating in today's meeting, especially those -- recognizing that we've got this big weather storm forecast, at least for those of us here on the East Coast, it's great that you were all still able to make it. And for all of those who you are on webcast, welcome. I hope your weather is better and we're glad that you could also join us for the event today. 
When we look back on it, I think and hope you'll agree, 2013 was really a significant year for Johnson & Johnson. In fact, it's pretty hard for me to believe that it's only been a year since we met in a hotel not too far from here in 2012 to review our performance in 2012 and also set out the goals for 2013. And while time has passed relatively quickly, I'm also very proud to report just how much we've accomplished since last year's meeting. 
Let's start first with our near term priorities. Number one, we've exceeded our financial commitments. We've continued to restore reliable supply -- the majority of our over-the-counter products here in the United States, and we're working very closely with our trade partners to get product back on the shelves and really relaunch these great brands. 
We've also made substantial progress on the integration of Synthes. We're creating, not only the world's largest, but the most comprehensive orthopaedics platform in business in the industry. Very importantly, as you heard Louise talk about, we've continued building on our strong momentum in our Pharmaceutical business, which is leading the industry on so many different fronts. 
We've made a lot of progress against these short-term drivers, but we've also advanced our long-term growth drivers, as well. Things like creating value through innovation; having a global reach with a local focus; excellence in execution in everything that we're doing; and leading with a purpose to really make a difference for patients, for customers around the world.  ¶                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
At the same time, we are focused hard on leveraging the power of our Enterprise in a number of ways that are serving to increase the overall effectiveness and efficiency of Johnson & Johnson. Let me give you just a few examples. 
Number one, we've improved our quality program, but we've also strengthened and streamlined our supply chain to ensure that we can reliably meet demand around the world. We've also bolstered our post-market surveillance and safety teams. 
We've acted decisively to prioritize our product portfolios, focusing on areas where we really think we can apply our energies to make the greatest opportunities and lead the industry and ultimately make a real difference for patients. And we worked hard to resolve certain complex legal matters. 
Meetings like these -- these types of forums -- we believe provide us with a great opportunity to update you on our progress, as well as our plans and our perspectives about how we think things are going to unfold in the future. Dominic and Louise -- and you all know Louise, she always has that big binder -- she's going to take us through a lot of information today. Any really tough questions, we'll make sure she can find the answers somewhere in there. 
But I personally believe that, while you're going to hear a lot of different information, the most important take-away from today is for you to better understand why all of us at Johnson & Johnson remain so optimistic about our future in our ability to positively impact the lives of patients and consumers, in spite of so many global challenges facing healthcare delivery around the world. So let me start the way I always do.  Let's talk about our credo. 
2013 was the 70th anniversary of this document. So our Management teams around the world did a credo challenge and really spent time considering what it means today to our Business, what it means to us as leaders. We've collectively confirmed that it is as essential as ever. 
As we've grown to more than 128,000 associates around the world, this brief but very powerful document really unites us with a common purpose. I believe it remains as important, as relevant today as ever, and that its principles are very deeply embedded in the way we conduct our business, in the way we do everything. 
As you all know, the most important driver of success is ultimately the people who make these strategies come alive. I'm really proud of our executive management team. When you look at this group, they have a wide range of diverse backgrounds and experiences. It's a nice combination of long, tenured, seasoned Johnson & Johnson executives and newer additions to the leadership team, with strong and diverse industry backgrounds. Together, I believe we're poised to lead, and frankly, to shape the evolving healthcare industry and market and really bringing new ways of doing business coming together with customers, governments and payers. 
We're proud of our strong foundation but we're also embracing changes that we think are demanded by a healthcare landscape that's changing in so many different ways. We're decisive, we're disciplined, and focused against executing on our near-term priorities but also staying focused on a our longer-term growth strategies. 
With that as a bit of a foundation, let's take a look at our performance overall for 2013. The advancements we made by working with such a laser focus on our near-term priorities has had a direct impact on us being able to deliver our results. 
The Enterprise grew 6.1% versus 2012. As you heard earlier, that's 7.7% operationally on strong sales of $71.3 billion. If you net things out for the Synthes acquisition, operational sales growth was still a really solid 5.2%. 
With our continued focus on financial discipline, our adjusted earnings were $15.9 billion, up 10.7%. Adjusted EPS was $5.52, up 8.2% versus last year. We also generated significant free cash flow of $13.8 billion. 
As the largest healthcare Company in the world, our broad base of leadership is increasingly important in our ability to deliver strong results in a sustainable way over time. As you can see, our Consumer segment accounted for 21% of our total sales by generating $14.7 billion, up 2.8% on an operational basis versus 2012, and nearly 4% operational growth excluding the impact of certain acquisitions and divestitures. 
40% of our sales, or about $28.5 billion, come from our Medical Devices and Diagnostics group, with operational sales growth of 6.1% which now includes Synthes for a full year. If we exclude acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was approximately 1%. 
Our Pharmaceutical segment generated $28.1 billion, an outstanding 12% operational growth versus 2012, and that accounts for the remaining 39%. On the strength of this performance, we generated $19 billion in pre-tax operating profit, excluding special items, a 90 basis point improvement versus the previous year. Pharmaceutical pre-tax operating margin grew 370 basis points due to its strong sales performance. 
We also saw a nice uptick in our Consumer group. The decline, however, in MD&D was driven by lower diabetes pricing and, of course, the Medical Device Tax. 
Our shareholders, they're rewarded with a return of almost 35%, which really outpaced about nearly every major index we benchmark ourselves against. If you look long-term, we believe our shareholders have also done well and we've outpaced each of these indices over the past 10 years. We've delivered 30 consecutive years of adjusted earnings increases and 51 consecutive years of dividend increases, making us only one of six companies in the S&P 100 to achieve that kind of a record. 
The depth of our leadership is reflected by the fact that approximately 70% of our sales come from the number one or number two market share position. We're seeing that our investments in research and development are helping us to continually deliver meaningful innovations to customers, with about 25% of our sales coming from products that have been introduced or launched just within the last five years. 
We believe these facts demonstrate that our Business is strong. I'd really like to congratulate the associates of Johnson & Johnson around the world for their commitment to delivering this kind of success. 
We're very fortunate at Johnson & Johnson to serve more than a billion healthcare patients and consumers around the world each and every day. It's the responsibility of everyone across our great Enterprise and we consider it a privilege and actually a great source of pride. Let's go through some of the highlights. 
Growth in the Consumer segment was achieved in part as a result of our success in restoring a reliable supply of OTC products to the United States marketplace and we're starting to see them gain traction as well once they're back in the market. I'd like to acknowledge Sandi Peterson for her leadership in this segment over the past year. Together with Lynn Pendergrass, who joined us in September as the Worldwide Chairperson for the Consumer segment, they're building a Best-in-Class global marketing organization to continue growing the image and share of these iconic brands. 
Part of that effort also includes focusing the portfolio to meet the evolving needs of customers in local markets around the world. To do this, we've identified a select set of specific consumer need states and have developed 12 major brands that we believe are going to drive the majority of our growth. 
Many of these major brands grew well in the fourth quarter, including NEUTROGENA, LISTERINE, [Baby], and particularly TYLENOL and MOTRIN, which drove US OTC growth of about 22%. We're going to continue backing these brands with strong scientifically-based endorsed claims to differentiate them in the marketplace. 
In line with these efforts, we're going to tighten our focus we've divested in certain areas, such as North America Women's Sanitary Protection business. We acquired Elsker, a leading Chinese baby products Company. But we also continue to expand globally to launch things like LISTERINE Advanced Defence Gum Therapy in places like the UK and Ireland and our new Johnson's Baby Triple Protection product line, which we're taking out to global markets this year. 
As all of you know, in OTCs, our priority for the past several years has been to deliver a reliable supply of products to the marketplace. Last year, very importantly, we met our objective of returning approximately 75% of our planned portfolio to the store shelves. 
US OTCs ended 2013 with the number one or number two product SKUs in both adult and pediatric pain categories. We're also investing in things like cross-channel marketing across TV, print, social media, to really support their launch and do it in a benchmark way. 
Finally, as we work to bring our plants fully back online, we've executed all of the milestones to date in our FDA consent decree. This is very important. With the significant progress that we made in returning our US over-the-counter products to the shelves, a tighter strategy on focusing our portfolio, our Consumer business is well-positioned to continue to grow in 2014 and beyond. 
With MD&D, let's talk first about the market dynamics. The early fourth-quarter data we've seen frankly shows mixed performance. 
It generally indicates that rates of surgical lab procedures here in the US basically remained flat over the last 12 months and we've discussed that with you in prior meetings. However, there's also some early signs of improvements in areas like orthopaedics. 
Overall, we believe that as economies recover, healthcare reform starts taking hold here in the US and abroad, utilization rates are going to increase and we remain very confident in the long-term prospects for this market. With that said, we know that our growth long-term is going to be outlined by our ability to continuously delivering innovations that ultimately make a meaningful difference for patients and for our customers around the world. 
As you know, Johnson & Johnson is the leading Company in this segment, with 85% of our key platforms, the number one or number two positions in the market. Integrating Synthes has been our number one priority and we've made good progress on that and I'll discuss more of that in just a moment. 
Emerging markets in this segment are also a really important driver of growth and we've been successful in developing, making products specifically for these markets that are driving growth within our Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment. We're also increasing our competitiveness in this dynamic global market in order to better position our Business for future growth by investing in innovations that will help us increase our leadership positions, by optimizing our portfolio to ensure we're focusing in areas where we feel we can really have the greatest impact. 
DePuy Synthes is the world's largest and most comprehensive orthopaedics company within a $44 billion market that has got strong fundamentals. It is primed now to offer new, value-added solutions that will help transform healthcare delivery, let alone in orthopaedics. 
Orthopaedic operational growth for the full year of 2013 was approximately 2% worldwide excluding the net impact of the Synthes acquisition. We finished the year strong, with solid fourth-quarter operational growth of over 4%, representing our strongest quarter of the year. In the quarter itself, worldwide operational growth of 8% in things like knees, 5% in hips, were the major driver of this performance. 
Our primary goal during the integration of Synthes has been to continue to grow our strong market positions while minimizing customer disruption. We clearly acknowledge we still have got some more work to do but I've been very encouraged, particularly as of late, to see some of the steps we're doing in things like cross-selling initiatives that we had envisioned from the onset. 
We see these things starting to take hold, as well as revenue and cost saving synergies that's going to make this business extremely competitive going forward. The team is also taking a lot of important steps to integrate the internal systems and processes, which of course, these kind of things are foundational to make sure we set it up for the long-term success that we know it deserves. 
We have a strong leadership position in the medical device market, anchored by $11 billion plus platforms, including things like vision care, trauma, sutures, endoscopy, electrophysiology. We've got a lot other others that we believe have got the potential to get there. 
One of these is biosurgicals, which develops sophisticated products used to help control bleeding. This platform grew 8% operationally in 2013 and we're especially excited about the EVARREST Fibrin Sealant Patch, which has demonstrated a really unique ability to control bleeding in a variety of situations that is far superior to the current standard of care. 
It's now approved in both the United States as well as in Europe, and we're making good progress in our ability to make sure we have the right production capacity in place, because we believe we're going to have strong demand. In the meantime, we're taking very thoughtful and disciplined approaches to allocating our current limited supply. 
Our ability to readily develop and launch new products is ultimately what drives this business. In the last two years alone, we've invested approximately $3.5 billion in research and development to advance this portfolio even further and it's brought some strong dynamic products to the market over that time span, including things like the ATTUNE knee system, which now we have over 23,000 implanted worldwide; it's off to a very successful start. 
The ENSEAL G2 Articulating Tissue Sealer is making it easier for surgeons worldwide to assess difficult-to-reach places and parts of the anatomy. It's a great technology. 
Also our ThermoCool SmartTouch Contact Forcing Sensing Catheter, which actually measures the force, the contact force of a catheter's tip inside the heart during an ablation procedure. It's enhancing outcomes for patients in Europe. We plan to launch it in the United States later this year. 
Its uptake has helped drive double-digit operational sales growth at Biosense Webster. I had the pleasure of just visiting that team earlier this month and I can tell you the team is smart, committed, passionate, to delivering even more innovations for healthcare that we think are also ultimately going to drive that business forward. 
The products that I've mentioned are just a few of the really exciting and dynamic innovations that demonstrate our ability to meet the needs of surgeons and healthcare systems. I'd like to recognize the jobs that our of two worldwide chairs in this segment, Gary Pruden and Michel Orsinger and their teams, are doing to grow this business. 
While we've launched a lot of great products, invested a lot in research and development, we're also being prudent about how we're allocating resources with respect to our Medical Devices and Diagnostics portfolio. As we're doing across the entire Enterprise, we're realigning our Organization to focus on what we believe are the most promising opportunities. 
In line with our emphasis to increase the focus within our portfolios, we have a Company-wide premise that we should be number one or number two in the categories where we compete, have a clear path forward to getting there, or the businesses must really complement one of our other existing businesses. If we don't have businesses that meet those requirements, we're committed to considering strategic options for them. 
If you remember, last January, we made a decision to explore strategic options for Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business. As we explored strategic alternatives over the course of the year, we determined that a divestiture would be ultimately the best option for this business and also create the greatest value for Johnson & Johnson. 
On Thursday, we announced that we received a binding offer from the Carlyle Group to acquire it for about $4 billion. We're now in an acceptance period that will end on March 31. We expect this transaction will close sometime during the middle of the year. 
Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics plays a very important role in healthcare and we're confident that it's well-positioned to continue serving the interests of patients, customers, and employees. We're also very committed to working with the Carlyle Group to make sure that this transition goes as seamlessly as possible during this period. 
Let's move on to Pharmaceuticals. By any measure, the performance of this group has really been exceptional. We're the fastest growing of the 10 pharmaceutical companies in the United States, in Europe, and Japan. We recorded 15 consecutive quarters of operational sales growth in this segment. 
We believe our success is driven by several important factors. First, as always, it starts with great science, which has consistently delivered meaningful advancements for patients over existing therapies. The 13 new products that we've launched since 2009, coupled with the core strength of our brands including PREZISTA, REMICADE, VELCADE, have greatly contributed to our 2013 operational sales growth in this segment. 
We've also have continued to see great productivity in our pipeline, with the launch of three new major medicines this year -- INVOKANA for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes; IMBRUVICA for mantel cell lymphoma; and OLYSIO for the treatment of chronic hepatitis-C. We've been very successful in sourcing these innovations, both internally as well as externally, and we expect to continue this strategy. 
Next, and very importantly, I believe our teams have done a great job in executing strong clinical development programs to optimally characterize these therapies. As an example, consider the extensive number of patients we've enrolled in the registration trials for XARELTO and the direct [comparative] claims that we have in the label of INVOKANA and multiple indications we've obtained for XARELTO and ZYTIGA. 
Third, we have really solidified our commercial excellence and programs and launch execution processes. Our recently-launched products have done extremely well in terms of launch uptake and it's really impressive when you consider some of the new competition that's entered the market, as well. 
And fourth, we've increased our access through strong reimbursement and contracting abilities. The comprehensive drug profiles and dossiers really make a strong difference when you go to the market and help our account teams gain broad access so that patients globally can ultimately have easier and broader access to our products. 
We believe these important elements are going to continue to position us for growth well into the future. It's really also a testament to the great work that's been done by Joaquin Duato and Dr. Paul Stoffels and their teams, who have developed and executed this plan so well. 
XARELTO, INVOKANA, ZYTIGA, illustrate the type of dramatic launch success we're seeing here in the United States. XARELTO total scripts in cardiology continue to increase and now have over a 20% share even in the face of new competition. 
INVOKANA's uptake has been making it rapidly becoming the world's leading agent among endocrinologists and new-to-brand share [in] ZYTIGA, even with new competition, it's steadily gaining share. Together with its 88% share in the G5 markets across Europe, ZYTIGA is a strong contributor to over $1 billion in sales that have been generated in oncology just within the fourth quarter, which is a milestone for that therapeutic category. 
Looking to the future, we're really pleased with the focus [deep] of productive pharmaceutical pipelines and we expect the growth of our recently-launched products to continue and actually accelerate. Furthermore, we'll continue investing in research and development that is focused on key unmet needs for patients. As we announced at the Pharmaceutical segment business review last May, we plan to file more than 10 NMEs for approval between 2013 and 2017 and over 25 additional line extensions for our in-market products. 
So looking ahead, we know that healthcare is evolving quickly, so I want to provide our perspective on where we think it's going and how we're shaping, redefining our businesses to make sure that we're ready and lead through this wave of change that we expect to happen in the healthcare marketplace. The opportunity in healthcare is immense with an overall spend of about $8.4 trillion and the demand for healthcare products worldwide and services, it continues to grow and it's being driven by an aging population and an increasing middle class. At $2.5 trillion, products account for nearly 30% of that spend, growing 3% to 4% a year, and the health services industry, which accounts for $6 trillion, is expected to grow by more than 5%. 
Despite going through radical changes as healthcare ministers and governments across the globe press for greater transparency around costs and quality. Yes, these dynamics, these influencers certainly present challenges, but they're also creating significant opportunities for Johnson & Johnson. 
We'll optimize the breadth, the depth, the size, and scale of our businesses to manage and to lead through this cycle, to meet the evolving stakeholder needs, frankly, that they're demanding. Our position in the industry, we believe, provides us with a unique perspective but also a responsibility. 
We believe healthcare is clearly one of the greatest challenges facing society today for every country, every community, every company, and every family. We believe that there are at least four imperatives for a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges of healthcare globally. 
First, our industry has got to make it a priority of expanding access to high-quality, affordable, and sustainable healthcare in every community. Access to high-quality healthcare isn't just a cost; rather, we think of it as an investment in society's future, productivity, frankly the overall quality of life. 
Second, we've got to make sure that the market is designed to encourage and reward innovation that adds demonstrable value in terms of improved outcomes for patients. In spite of all the advancements over the past several decades in treating things like cardiovascular disease, cancer, HIV, and other areas, we've still got a lot of work to do to cure things and to take care of areas such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, other infectious disease; these things are going to create significant additional burdens on the healthcare system if we don't make progress and if we don't do something about them. 
Next, we believe that care integration could also help solve so many of the issues that we're facing in healthcare. When we say care integration, it isn't just about products. Innovating new ways of partnering reimbursement, better integrating some of the insights and data into the overall management of healthcare is essential. 
We think that it can improve outcomes, potentially increase patient satisfaction, and definitely contribute to better cost management over the long run. If we only focus on the direct costs of one particular area and aspect [our] healthcare or if we fail to keep the patient at the very center of how we're doing this reform, it just won't be successful. 
Finally, we believe there's got to be a greater focus and emphasis on wellness and prevention. Although the world is making great advances in sick care, the best answer to deal with the growing epidemic of chronic disease is healthier lifestyles, a true dedication to wellness. 
We realize that this is not easy, but as we've seen with our own employees, investing in health and wellness programs has a positive and long-term impact on welfare and on cost. To me, that's one of the most promising frontiers around innovation. 
With that as a backdrop, here's our strategy for continuing to lead and succeed in this evolving healthcare marketplace. Our strategic framework for achieving our future growth goals should be very familiar to you. It naturally starts with our credo. It's our aspiration that by caring for the world one patient at a time, we're going to help billions of people around the world live longer, healthier, and happier lives. 
If we look at our long-standing strategic principles, we know that they'll remain the same at the core. However, we're also evolving these to make sure that we stay in tune with the current environment. 
We've discussed these principles with you many times but I'd like to focus on one for our discussion today, which is increasingly important given some of the changes that we're seeing. We believe that our broad base in healthcare and the strength of Johnson & Johnson as an Enterprise will be a very important differentiator in our evolving landscape. 
Think about it for a moment. The diversity of our science, technology, the product offerings provide us with a unique perspective to address complex, unmet medical needs within a rapidly changing healthcare environment. It enables us to maintain a strong footprint and presence in growth markets that represent an increasing share of our Business and it enables us to sustain consistently strong financial performance through a wide variety of business cycles. 
The power of our broad base starts first with the strength of each one of our different segments. This is a snapshot of our segment-by-segment strategy that we've discussed with you on previous occasions. This is going to continue to be the driving engine of most of our growth. 
It's our first intention to lead within each one of these segments with a strong focus on innovation, globalization, execution, and leadership. At the same time, we intend to use the power embedded across these segments in order to advance new ideas, new products, services, that will enable us to continue to optimize our resources and scale and to outpace the rate of change in the industry. To do so, we're dedicating teams to implement a core set of Enterprise-wide initiatives that will equip us to act in a more nimble and dynamic way in support of our growth strategy. 
As all of you know, everything begins with innovation and for the past five years we've consistently invested about 11% of our net trade sales to support our research and development efforts that equated to over $8 billion as an Enterprise in 2013. Our distinct innovation model is predicated on accessing the very best science to address unmet medical needs and then leveraging our own specialized capabilities to develop differentiated products. 
As you know, we're agnostic as to where the ideas emanate from and we'll access the best science internally or externally. We've demonstrated the success of our approach, first in our Pharmaceutical business, and we're applying the same philosophy across all of our other segments, as well. In fact, we've been relentless and have executed over 200 alliances, licensing and acquisitions, strategic partnerships across the Enterprise just over the last two years. 
Our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Paul Stoffels, chairs our Worldwide Research and Development Management Committee. He works with our R&D leaders across the Company to set and drive the Enterprise-wide innovation agenda by harnessing our deep internal expertise and platform capabilities, as well as by sourcing in externalization, to really fuel our pipelines. 
We've gotten off to a head start on this industry model by launching four innovation centers in key research communities around the world. These teams have quickly established credibility and trust and have already inked over 40 early-stage deals. 
Paul has done a tremendous job in leading the innovation platform and his leadership and track record for success is widely regarded across Johnson & Johnson, but even more importantly, across the industry. In fact, just a week ago, Paul was recognized by the leading life science CEOs with a prestigious lifetime achievement award. He really deserved it and we're incredibly proud of him. Congratulations, again, Paul. 
In addition to doing smart deals and focusing our R&D teams to increase our productivity, we believe that we've also got to offer innovative solutions. As I said earlier, it only matters if the best science can really be effectively delivered to customers and patients. 
We're going to measure our long-term success by our ability to leverage the specialized capability of the Johnson & Johnson Enterprise to achieve three key objectives that healthcare stakeholders today are demanding. They are improving outcomes, increasing patient satisfaction, and reducing costs and increasing access to healthcare around the world. 
Of all the companies in Johnson & Johnson, and in healthcare, we are uniquely positioned to create new and different partnerships that align with hospitals and payer strategies to transform from volume-based systems to value-based systems, with the ultimate goal of affordable solutions to deliver a better clinical outcome and patient experience. We've already established a new deployment model, an Enterprise-wide account team, that can represent our entire portfolio in unique ways to each customer, in order to customize the best solution for that particular customer. 
Our teams have been working for several months to create and execute pilots with a few prominent healthcare systems here in the United States and to enhance some of the work we're already doing more broadly with other customers as well. It's early on but I'm particularly excited about the possibilities. 
A good example of how we can deploy differently to better serve customers is in knee replacement procedures. We actually have several comprehensive offerings but I'll just touch on about four of them this morning. 
First, Care4Today Orthopaedic Solutions focuses on improving continuity of care and recovery through patient education and empowerment, but as well as by providing post-surgery support, both in the hospital, as well as at home. Second, True Match brings a new level of personalized total knee replacement surgery to the OR, based on the proven philosophy of mechanical alignment, with customized patient instruments and systems designed to really aid in knee implant positioning and to increase the efficiency of the procedure as well. 
Third, with SterilMed integrated reprocessing, we aim to deliver direct savings to hospital budgets by combining both new and previously reprocessed instruments in one simple sterile container. Finally, we're piloting a procedure-based outcomes contracting agreement that's essentially a risk-sharing program with hospitals, tied to positive re-admission trends. This is just one example of an industry mindset, a changing approach, and really us accelerating the realization of our vision to reshape the healthcare delivery system with total solution offerings that add value to the system and ultimately expand our Business. 
As we expand our businesses, particularly in other parts of the world, we're increasingly executing our globalization strategy with an Enterprise-wide lens to better drive our success in these markets. These charts demonstrate an increasing importance that these countries have to our overall business. For example, in 2013, 55% of our sales came from markets outside the United States, while emerging markets accounted for roughly 22% of our total sales. 
Johnson & Johnson has been operating in China for over 28 years, and while many of our competitors are currently expanding in the region, our strong heritage and business foundation provides a unique viewpoint for us to look at growth. When I met with you last January, I discussed the potential of our business in China, which, given the population, unmet medical needs, demographic changes, and steps the government is taking to enhance the healthcare system and expand that access, we believe it represents enormous opportunity. The Chinese market, the healthcare market, is large and growing, and healthcare expenditures are expected to increase about 14% a year through 2017. 
Today it's almost at $3 billion -- it's a $2.8 billion business for us -- and the dynamic environment there really demands new ways of working, which relies on the strengths of our combined three businesses. It capitalizes on our scale, our breadth, as well as the very unique strength of the Johnson & Johnson brand equity. 
We've taken important steps to invest in continued growth there. Last fall, we appointed Jesse Wu to the role of Chairman, Johnson & Johnson China, a new Enterprise-wide leadership position. Jesse comes from the region and he's been a leader within our great Company for more than 25 years and he's got a strong track record of success. But he's working now to optimize our capabilities and really to drive growth in China by enhancing our ability to meet the country's unmet healthcare needs. 
Each of our businesses still runs their respective businesses. However, in his Chairman's role, Jesse is representing a consistent Johnson & Johnson interface to key external stakeholders, particularly to the government and to the talent that we're trying to bring into the Organization. From his Enterprise-wide vantage point, he's going to be better suited to identify and facilitate and actually create opportunities for growth going forward. 
The Enterprise-wide view looks a little bit different in Southeast Asia, where we've rolled out a model that we call One Johnson & Johnson. There, we've aligned our operations and management from nine different countries, including Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines -- we brought into a single, $1.4 billion business. In this construct, we think we're going to be more efficient, while also increasing our ability to compete in these [small or] mid-sized markets with more streamlined approaches, led by one managing director. 
Also, foundational to our growth strategy is excellence in execution. It's essential. As we did in defining the best strategies for growing our Business, we've also spent a considerable amount of time and energy examining our internal processes and structures, as well. 
The entire executive leadership team at Johnson & Johnson has been focusing on ways to ensure that every product we test, that we develop, that we manufacture, achieves world-class quality standards, allowing us to responsibly meet the demand of customers and consumers and patients around the world. Our focus has been on strengthening and streamlining our supply chain to ensure that we can reliably meet demand. 
As I said earlier, we've continued to meet the goals under the consent decree to bring our United States over-the-counter products back online. We've also implemented a new quality and compliance operating model, which is ensuring more consistent standards and capabilities are in place across all of our product lines, our businesses, and different geographies. 
Our Chief Medical and Chief Quality Officers are setting new benchmarks for medical safety and implementing a more consistent global approach for monitoring the use of our end market products that is very patient- and consumer-centric for ensuring that they are safe and performing as expected and as intended. While we're pleased with the progress that we've made here, we're not yet satisfied and we'll keep doing whatever it takes to ensure that we continue to earn the trust of consumers and patients around the world. 
Stay with me for a moment on excellence in execution. Last year we kicked off an Enterprise-wide standards and productivity initiative to strengthen our functional capabilities around the world in order to better enable, first, our businesses to grow, but also continue to improve our cost competitiveness. 
We've already identified benefits from this effort and we project that we'll achieve approximately $1 billion in savings over the next three years so we can reinvest back in the Business. Also it helps us offset some of the expected pricing pressures that we anticipate on the horizon in this healthcare environment. 
It's also our belief that Johnson & Johnson holds a greater responsibility to lead with a purpose and that by doing so, all of our stakeholders will benefit, as defined by our credo. Our success is measured by our ability to advance the health and wellness, by improving the quality of people's lives, and through contributions of about $1 billion in products and cash. We've supported over 500 community programs in more than 60 countries in 2013 that address the unique needs of families and communities around the world. 
First, we're committed to advancing global health to fight multi-drug-treatment-resistant tuberculosis and are working with health authorities to make SIRTURO, which has received a positive CHMP recommendation for approval in the European Union and was just approved in Russia, more available also in other parts of the world. We're also continuing to enter royalty-free licensing agreements to make SIRTURO and other important life-saving medications available in other developing countries. 
We've got a strong track record of doing this. Today, 66 countries have at least two of our four HIV medicines available at special-effort pricing. 
We also believe in wellness. We're proud to be sponsoring a program right here in the United States -- in fact right here in our backyard. In cities such as Atlanta and with school systems in Houston and Philadelphia and Newark, working with our Human Performance Institute, which trains high-performing athletes and executives to work at peak levels, we've engineered and launched a Johnson & Johnson 7 Minute Workout app. 
It's fast, scientifically proven. App is simple, for your mobile device. There's no more excuses. It's got over 1,000 exercise options. It's free on iTunes and on Android. I hope you'll download it and give it a try. New Year's resolution. 
Our engaged teams do a tremendous job every day and I've been talking with you for about the last 45 minutes about the collective results that we're very proud of. I'd like to again thank each and every one of our associates around the world for their continued commitment to the success of Johnson & Johnson. 
As we enter this year, we're going to remain focused on driving growth through the continued execution of our near-term priorities -- one, achieving our financial targets. Two, restoring a reliable supply of OTC products to shelves here in the United States and relaunching them. 
Making sure that they have best-in-class launch and support programs positioned to gain share. Continuing to capitalize on the potential of DePuy Synthes as an innovative driver of growth in orthopaedics and continuing to build on the strong momentum that we talked about with our Pharmaceuticals team. As well as our long-term growth drivers of innovation, globalization, execution, and leadership. 
Now, just a few final thoughts. Never before has the healthcare industry operated in a time of such remarkable change and also creating such dramatic opportunities for us. In this environment, it's absolutely essential that we balance our focus on our core capabilities and strengths, while also adapting better to evolving customer needs. 
To succeed, we're taking new approaches, working more collaboratively and shaping our Company to ultimately execute more efficiently. Johnson & Johnson is strong and poised for growth. 
Our success over time will be how we live up to the responsibilities, the commitments laid out in our credo, in helping patients and customers live longer, healthier, and happier lives; creating an environment where our employees can be their very best, excel, and innovate; of taking care of the communities by improving their access to care; and by continuing to generate a fair return for our shareholders. 
I couldn't be prouder to be part of this Organization and this incredible team at this pivotal time. Thank you very much for your support of Johnson & Johnson.

Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP, Finance & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Alex, and good morning everyone. I'd like to provide some comments on our 2013 fourth-quarter and full-year results and then provide some guidance for you to consider as you update your models for 2014. 
It's really a great pleasure to report on our exceptional performance in 2013, which was driven by the many successes that Alex previously discussed. Our strategy and momentum position us very well to continue our strong momentum and performance in the evolving healthcare marketplace. 
At the beginning of 2013, I provided you with an outlook of our financial performance for the year. We saw continued improvement in our results throughout the year, driven by stronger sales results and good expense management.  Our operational sales growth of 7.7%, as Louise described earlier, exceeded our guidance of 6% to 7% for the year. 
I'm also pleased to report that we've improved our pre-tax operating margin, excluding special items, by 90 basis points, and that our net income margin, also excluding special items, expanded to 22.3%. 
During the fourth quarter, we recorded several special items that netted to approximately $40 million on an after-tax basis, and which consisted of the following -- increased litigation accruals; a charge for in-process research and development; costs associated with the Synthes acquisition that is consistent with what we expected we would incur [as] special items throughout 2013 and which we expect will continue as that integration activity continues; an increase in our estimate for the costs associated with the DePuy ASR hip program for updated information, primarily related to the program outside the US. 
And finally, during the fourth quarter, cumulative losses exceeded the net worth of Scios, Inc. This necessitated the write-off of the acquired entity for tax purposes, which was previously written down for books purposes. This resulted in a tax benefit recognized in the fourth quarter as a special item. 
Together, these special items negatively impacted fourth-quarter results by $0.01 per share. Excluding these special items, our adjusted earnings per share were at $1.24 for the fourth quarter. 
During the fourth quarter, our tax planning efforts resulted in a lower tax rate, which offset some additional cost in the fourth quarter, related to the buyout of a royalty agreement and the planned shutdown of certain manufacturing operations with the resulting write-down of those related assets. Overall, the net impact of these items, along with the higher level of sales in the quarter, resulted in our EPS exceeding the mean of the [add-off] estimates as published by First Call. 
To wrap up our formal presentation this morning, I'd like to provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2014. Let me begin with a discussion of cash and interest income and expense. At the end of 2013, we had approximately $11 billion of net cash. This consists of approximately $29 billion of cash and marketable securities, and approximately $18 billion of debt. 
As you know, we recently completed a $3.5 billion debt offering. We did this to lock in some attractive long-term rates, and while this financing does increase the overall borrowing costs compared with shorter term commercial paper rates, on a long-term basis, the rates we obtained are very attractive. For purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions, I'd suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $400 million and $500 million, reflecting a higher level of interest expense than some of you have modeled. 
Now, turning to other income and expense. As a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, and also divestitures, asset sales, and write-offs. This account is always difficult to forecast but we would be comfortable with your models for 2014 reflecting other income and expense, excluding special items, as a net gain, ranging from approximately $600 million to $700 million, a lower level of income than some of you have modeled. 
Now, a word on taxes. For 2013, the Company's effective tax rate, excluding special items, was 17.2%, which was lower than our recent guidance as we were able to implement some tax planning items late in the year. This effective tax rate for 2013 includes the federal R&D tax credit for both 2012 and 2013. You may recall that the 2012 portion of this credit was recorded in the first quarter of 2013. 
Our guidance for 2014 anticipates that the R&D credit will be renewed by Congress, although that has not yet occurred. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2014, excluding special items, of approximately 18.5% to 19%. 
If the R&D tax credit is not approved, it will negatively impact the tax rate by approximately 0.5%. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities to improve upon this rate throughout the year. 
Now, turning to sales and earnings. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2014 takes into account several assumptions and key factors which I would like to highlight, which may not be fully reflected in your models. Those key assumptions and factors are as follows. 
For sales our assumption for PROCRIT is that there will not be biosimilar competition in 2014. For INVEGA SUSTENNA and RISPERDAL CONSTA, we do not anticipate generic entries for these products this year. 
And as for earnings, there are several factors to note. First, some comments about foreign currency fluctuations that impact real economic transactions as opposed to only translation, which I will discuss later. 
As we discussed on our third quarter call, the Japanese yen devalued by approximately 25% versus the US dollar and the euro in 2013. Impact of the yen devaluation on 2013 results was not significant because of our policy of hedging foreign currency transactions 12 to 18 months in advance.  However, the impact of the devaluation of the yen will be a significant headwind in 2014, and our 2014 guidance reflects a negative impact to gross margin in 2014 of approximately 60 basis points or an equivalent net impact to EPS of approximately $0.11. 
The yen weakened due to many factors. When foreign currency shifts are of a significant magnitude, it's not only difficult to adjust spending accordingly to offset the total impact, it's often not prudent to do so given the long-term impact of such actions compared to the potential shorter-term nature of the currency impact. Our guidance assumes we will have offset some of this impact but not all of it could be mitigated. 
Likewise, in the event of a significant devaluation of any other major currency, such as the Venezuelan bolivar, we will look to mitigate that impact, again depending on the magnitude of the impact. Such a potential devaluation of the bolivar or any other currency is not reflected in our guidance. 
Finally, as you know, we announced that we have received a binding offer for our clinical diagnostics business of approximately $4 billion. We expect the transaction to close within the next six months and that the resulting gain will be treated as a special item. Therefore, it will not impact our guidance at this time. 
When we update our guidance after the transaction closes, we will, of course, indicate the impact a divestiture would have on our sales and earnings per share, excluding special items, for the remainder of the year. As of today, we are considering how to best allocate the net after-tax proceeds from the divestiture in order to minimize the go-forward dilutive impact of not having that business contributing to our results in the future. 
As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our Business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our Business. 
We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2014 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. As of last week, the euro had strengthened versus the US dollar as compared to 2013 average levels. However, many other currencies have weakened versus the US dollar as compared to their average levels for 2013. 
Considering these factors I just noted, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting on an operational basis, a sales increase of between 3.7% and 4.7% for the year. This would result in sales for 2014 on a constant currency basis of approximately $73.9 billion to $74.7 billion. 
We are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales if currency exchange rates for all of 2014 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly a 0.5 percentage point. Thus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales to range between 3.2% and 4.2%, for a total expected level of reported sales of between $73.5 billion and $74.3 billion, which at the mid-point, is consistent with the analyst models as reflected in First Call, even considering a headwind of recent currency rates. 
Now turning to earnings. Our guidance reflects the major assumptions I noted earlier, specifically the negative impact of the weakening of the Japanese yen, which we estimate to be approximately $0.11 to EPS. 
As many of you are aware, we do not treat amortization expense as a special item. Our earnings guidance includes total amortization expense for the enterprise of approximately $1.3 billion on a pre-tax basis. 
We also expect to experience pricing pressures in 2014 across many markets, particularly in Europe. The impact of this negative pricing pressure is expected to negatively impact our pre-tax operating margins by approximately 50 basis points. 
Considering the factors I just noted, we suggest that you consider full-year 2014 EPS estimates, excluding the impact of special items, of between $5.70 and $5.80 per share on an operational or a constant currency basis. Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS, if currency exchange rates for all of 2014 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported EPS, excluding special items, would be positively impacted by approximately $0.05 per share, due to exchange rate fluctuations. 
We therefore suggest that you model our reported EPS, excluding special items, in the range between $5.75 and $5.85 per share, or a growth rate of 4% to 6%. At this early stage in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the mid-point of this range. 
As you update your models for the guidance that I just provided, you will see that we do expect that our pre-tax operating margins will show a slight improvement in 2014 over 2013 levels, despite the negative impact of the devaluation of the yen on our gross margin, and the expected incremental pricing pressures. This is due to continued focus on our operating expenses. You should also see that our net income margin will be approximately flat with prior year, due primarily to the increase in our effective tax rate. 
In closing, we're very pleased with our overall results for 2013 and we expect our growth and momentum to continue into 2014. We have the financial strength and breadth to execute on our near-term priorities and to deliver solid results, while also continuing to invest for long-term growth. 
I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. Thank you and I'll now turn it back to Louise for Q&A. Thanks.

Questions and Answers

Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Dominic. We'll now start the Q&A session. 
(Caller Instructions) 
Matt? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Dodds,  Citigroup - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, it's Matt Dodds of Citigroup. Alex, for you. 
The nice thing about the slides this year and last year is there were some tables that were the same. Emerging markets was actually 23% last year; this year was 22. Some of that was obviously US Pharma Consumer did really well. But can you give us an idea of what you're seeing in emerging markets broadly, what you may have seen in the fourth quarter, and your expectation for 2014 maybe versus 2013 in emerging markets in particular? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alex Gorsky,  Johnson & Johnson - Chairman & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, Matt.  Overall the headline that I'd encourage you to think about is we think that there's a big growth opportunity in emerging markets. In spite of some quarterly ups and downs, in spite of a few shifts here and there in specific segment or product performance, we see that these markets will likely continue to grow at about 3 to 4 times the growth rates that we're seeing in developed markets over the next several years. 
So specifically for Q4, there are things in Q4 of 2012 that you'd have to think about in 2013. But overall, what we're seeing for example in BRIC markets, growth for the year is about 12% and we saw performance slightly lower than that in Q4, again, impacted by a number of factors. 
If we look at our current business, clearly MD&D is our leader in the BRIC markets and has done very well. What you see is high-teen growth, sometimes exceeding 20% based upon the investments that we've made in research and development, manufacturing, and commercial presence in those markets. 
Our Consumer growth has also done well, and then impacted somewhat recently by some of the ingredient issues that we've faced. But here too, we've got a lot of market-appropriate products. We've invested significantly, as well, in manufacturing and commercial capabilities. 
Obviously, our Pharmaceutical group is a little bit different, because we have been very open about our strategic intent not to participate in the generic segment, which has an impact there, but we still believe there's a lot of opportunity to address both unmet need, as well as the business opportunity with some of our higher technology products. 
So overall -- and by the way, if you look at some of the other investments that we've made there in companies like DeBao several years ago, recently with Elsker, which expanded our presence in the baby segment. We also did the MD&D investment in our biosurgicals business, which will help us expand that platform there in the coming years. We remain very confident in the opportunities for growth there in the future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And just a quick follow-up-- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If I could just add something also on to that one. We had, as I discussed in my remarks, with Russia, with the tender on VELCADE, and we also had some tender business on REMICADE. So it's in the emerging markets, you have a lot more of tender business and it can cause some fluctuations. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Dodds,  Citigroup - Analyst    [6]

And then just quickly, the 7 Minute app, could you show us the burpee, Alex? (Laughter)

I'll be happy to join you afterwards, Matt. Come on out. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My money's on Alex. Mike? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Weinstein,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan. I'll try and keep this to two questions, but may stretch a little bit. 
First question, Dominic, the constant currency or actually operational, I don't know if operational is actually constant currency. I think it is for you guys, but--? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP, Finance & CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. That's the way we refer to it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Weinstein,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just to be clear, you don't have divestitures in there, too, right? You have a bunch of divested products and businesses that you're not backing out? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP, Finance & CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. When I talk about operational, I'm just talking about excluding any impact of currency only. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Weinstein,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. Okay. 
The 3.7% to 4.7% would imply a deceleration from 2013 and certainly the way the year ended up. Could you talk about why that would be the case? Obviously, pharma, it's tough to sustain 12% revenue growth, but you've got a lot of momentum in that business. So what are you assuming decelerates in 2013, or are you assuming no improvement in MD&D, as well? 
Then the second question, and this is both a Dominic and Alex question, but the one incredibly underutilized asset at J&J is the balance sheet. We've been talking for years about the cash that's trapped outside the US. It's significant; it's growing. All your cash flow is outside the US after you pay your dividend. At what point do you change your thinking on this and actually start to repatriate? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP, Finance & CFO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Well, on the growth rate, it's a story of a very high base in the Pharmaceutical business after a tremendous year, and in fact, although the Pharmaceutical business will continue to grow, it just won't grow at the same rate that it grew at in 2013, given the high base that it's already at after a pretty fantastic year. So that alone accounts for the majority of the difference in what you're referring to as a deceleration in growth. 
We do expect MD&D and Consumer to pick up in growth. The Pharma comparisons are tough year-over-year. And we ended the year at about -- good strong growth. We did have some good opportunities in the year that, again, form a base for which then to grow off of makes it just difficult. It's early in the year. This is our view. We try to take everything into consideration. We provide you our estimates. But that's our current expectation. Of course, we'll update you throughout the year. 
I'll give just a few comments on cash and I'll turn it. Obviously, cash, we generate as you know, mostly outside the US, and it does grow, because of our healthy cash position. We obviously look to maintain the increase in our dividend, so we don't view that as a hindrance to doing that. We're still able to do that. We you view that as a great opportunity to invest in the long-term growth of our Business, as you saw with the Synthes transaction, where we were able to use cash outside the US for a significant acquisition. 
So we'll always look to do those kinds of things with the cash first, continue our dividend, and invest in growing the Business. But at some point, and I'm not prepared to give you that point today, at some point, we would consider whether repatriating the cash would be a prudent thing to do. At the current US tax rate and with the current penalty, quite frankly, on the repatriation, it appears to us that that's not a good way to utilize the cash, and it provides for a significant diminution in value to our shareholders by doing so. Anything else?

Larry? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Biegelsen,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo. Two for Alex. 
One, Alex, you've discussed publicly that you're re-evaluating your cardiovascular medical device strategy. It's an area where you have a strong presence in only one area: A-fib. How do you view the attractiveness of those markets now, and how important is it for J&J to have a stronger presence in the cardiovascular device space? 
My follow-up is the orthopaedic commentary was encouraging that you made earlier. How confident are you that that's not a pull-forward ahead of the implementation of the ACA. Any signs that you can point to that give you confidence that that's sustainable? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alex Gorsky,  Johnson & Johnson - Chairman & CEO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. Thank you, Larry. Let me start with the first one. 
Overall, we continue to think that the cardiovascular area is certainly an area of a lot of unmet medical need and also represents an opportunity for us. The decision we made several years ago of streamlining our current cardiovascular portfolio was, in fact, the right one. If you take a look at the dynamics in the stent market, and even more product in CRM and some other areas, they've been pretty challenging lately for a number of different reasons. 
So making that decision helped us better focus on areas like EP and Biosense Webster where I'd say I couldn't be more proud of that team. When you look now, we've got over 15 quarters of about 13% plus growth. At the same time, they've made significant investments in new technology that continued to enable them to improve patient outcomes with new product launches. 
We've also done a very nice job and I'd compliment Gary Pruden and Shlomi Nachman on the job they've done in the rest of the business, in streamlining what we're doing in the endovascular space, as well. If you look at overall performance of our cardiovascular group through some very prudent, relatively minor investments, and frankly just better execution, that business, we think, is on much better footing now than it was before. 
We noted, really over the last 24 months, that we're continuing to look at renal denervation. Of course, you saw the recent information that was released by one of our competitors regarding their device. We have our own approach. We remain hopeful in this area. As we know, if we can truly achieve some of the drops in blood pressure that we're seeing in some of the other trials, that could have a tremendous impact for patients. We continue to pursue that. 
We're looking at AAA, obviously. We continue to be interested there. And we're watching the other spaces accordingly. The transcatheter aortic valves are still in the midst of their launch, working their way through, not only the technology issues -- of course, now we'll have two options on the market, as they work their way through reimbursement. We'll watch that closely, as well as the others. So we remain interested, but we think being where we are right now is a good place to be. 
If I look at orthopedics for a moment, we were encouraged by the trends that we saw really later in the third and heading into the fourth quarter. As I mentioned during my talk, the data is still somewhat mixed overall when we take a look at utilization. So let's start with the hospital data. A lot of you share that. If you look at inpatient procedures, if you look at surgical procedures, if you look at outpatient procedures, if you look at lab tests, they remained essentially flat through the end of the year. 
We saw physician visits up slightly, and I mean slightly, 1%, 2%. And of course, we saw improvements in hips, knees, and trauma in the fourth quarter. I'm really proud of what our DePuy Synthes team did in the fourth quarter. If you look at our underlying hip business, we grew 5% on a worldwide basis, we grew 8% in the US. If you look at knees we grew 8% worldwide; we you grew 9% in the US. If you look at trauma, we grew 7% worldwide; we grew 10% in the United States. 
The 10% was somewhat accelerated because of what happened in the fourth quarter of last year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       But if we look at for underlying fundamentals, what we're seeing with accounts, what we're seeing with customers in the field, we remain very hopeful. We think we're going to have to watch the Affordable Care Act and its impact here in the United States closely. 
Just recently, the Congressional Budget Office, as well as Senior MEA, if the you look at their assumptions and projections about numbers of patients, they've been reduced substantially, based upon sign-up rates. So we do expect there to be some assistance there. Probably not at the rate that was earlier projected. But overall -- and of course, there's also the fourth-quarter dynamic in the orthopedics market of people utilizing all of their healthcare benefit, as well. 
So we're cautiously optimistic, I would say, regarding the fundamentals of some of these markets. Longer term, we still think they represent a very significant opportunity. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Audience Member,   -     [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks. So one question, you mentioned in your presentation, Alex, this performance-based risk-sharing arrangement that you're pursuing with some of your orthopedics, something that's worked for you in the past, VELCADE and RISPERDAL. If you could talk a little about that, and whether we're going to see more of that in devices? And I have one follow-up. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alex Gorsky,  Johnson & Johnson - Chairman & CEO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, as I mentioned, and actually as we've envisioned over the past several years, we have a strong belief that in the evolving healthcare marketplace today, that in many areas that customers, certainly hospitals under increasing pressure, are going to be looking for, frankly, ways of creating new partnerships with customers, and moving from just a volume-based model to a much broader portfolio model. And as we look at that, we think that we're very well-positioned. 
I want to be clear that our number one focus is still on bringing new innovative products to market, gaining share. We think there's a lot of opportunity. But we also think that the unique depth and breadth of our portfolio, especially in areas like orthopedics, where we touch so many of the different spaces, but even more broadly, if you just think about a knee or a hip procedure, and if you combine what we do on the surgical side with our hemostats, with our energy instrumentation, along with what you might see in the prosthetic device, the instruments itself, potentially longer-term, even with our pharmaceutical line, we think that we have a unique offering. 
So, on a selective basis right now, we have been working with customers to contract with them in a different way. So it's -- again, it's still early. But we think, in the right areas, this can be a substantial opportunity for us to grow our share, as well as to work closely with hospitals in helping them better manage outcomes and costs. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Audience Member,   -     [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One follow-up, if I could, on spine. Not to pick on a place where you're seeing some continued challenges there, obviously, very strong hips and knees, but the integration, the market, maybe shared dynamics, can you give us a sense of maybe intermediate long-term strategy for getting that back to market or better growth rates? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alex Gorsky,  Johnson & Johnson - Chairman & CEO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's a good point. We continue to believe that the spine market long-term is a very good opportunity. When you think about it, the number two reason why someone goes to a physician or makes a physician visit is for back pain. We know that that market has undergone a lot of change over the past few years and we've certainly felt that. We do feel if we look at the overall integration of DePuy and Synthes, that one challenge for us was clearly in the spine, and we recognized that going into it, when you had to bring that organization, that's where there was the greatest amount of overlap versus hips, knees, and trauma, sports medicine, and other areas. We did see higher sales force turnover, frankly, than we would have liked to see. 
I think Michel and Gary Fischetti and his team have done a nice job of addressing many of those concerns. I think our performance in Q4, while still not where we want it to be, is showing some improving trends. In fact, outside the United States, we were actually positive. 
So we think that -- and also, with some of the complementary nature of some of the underlying technology that we have in the other orthopedic segments, that scientifically, commercially, contractually, it will be an important piece of our Business. We're confident that we'll get that back to a growth rate that may not be reflective of the growth rate that you saw several years ago, that we saw several years ago in spines, but nonetheless is a healthy and sustainable one for the business. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rick? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rick Wise,  Stifel Nicolaus & Company - Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, it's Rick Wise, Stifel. 
Maybe I'll focus first, Alex, on Consumer, if I could. You said that 75% of the products are back. Clearly, you had a good quarter. A couple things there. What's it going to take to get all the way back to that -- recapture the full revenues that you lost? And maybe relative to product reformulation, like we saw a newspaper report on Sunday, article about taking certain products out, is this going to slow your progress as you reformulate? 
Then I have one follow-up. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alex Gorsky,  Johnson & Johnson - Chairman & CEO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. Thanks, Rick. 
And then again I'd like to note, and first of all, congratulate Sandi and Lynn and our entire Consumer team, for what I do think was strong performance throughout 2013, but certainly in Q4. And just a couple things to note. One is we've obviously have been really focused on making sure that we meet all of our consent decree requirements. We've learned a lot through that process. It's taken an integrative effort on the part of our supply chain, our information technology group, our business partners. Sitting here today, having met all of our consent decree requirements thus far, we continue to gain confidence now in our ability going forward to do just that. 
So we still have a substantial volume that we'd have to make up to get back to the earlier volumes that we saw. But every time we introduce the product to the market, Extra Strength TYLENOL, if you look at Children's TYLENOL, Children's MOTRIN Pediatric, we're seeing customers respond. We began not only focusing on the remediation, but really the relaunch program by the McNeil team, particularly in the fourth quarter. I'm sure you saw some of that in the media, in the advertising. We've seen a very nice response, an uptake as a result of that. So we continue to bring things back online. But, obviously, we've got to do that in a very thoughtful, disciplined way to make sure that we meet all the requirements as well as launch them. 
The other factor is, though, we're very pleased with the partnership that's been taking place with our major trade partners. All the major outlets have been enthusiastic about working with us to get these brands back on the shelves. 
Now, while I'm very proud of that, I'm also very proud of what we're seeing in our core brands. If you look at the core strength of things like baby care, up 6% for the quarter; LISTERINE, up 6%, actually about 8.5% outside the United States. If we look at OTCs, you heard 21%, 22% growth in the United States, very strong growth. Overall skin was up over 9%. And that's really being driven by Jennifer Aniston; the campaign, the great science and technology in NEUTROGENA; AVEENO turned in strong growth. 
As you know, in the Consumer Group, it takes great scientifically-driven innovation, combined with strong innovation in advertising, great retail partnerships and programs, to really drive that together. But now we're in a much better position with our core business, as well as our OTC business, to really have our Consumer Group deliver the kind of performance that we would expect longer term. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rick Wise,  Stifel Nicolaus & Company - Analyst    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If I could ask an MD&D bigger picture question. You've discussed this from several angles, but frankly, even though you've got some amazing franchises, we all know it, the portfolio seems relatively over-weighted in mature products, in mature markets. At this point, you're still growing, I would say, at the lower end of the industry's relatively depressed growth. Maybe you don't see it that way. I'd be curious if you don't agree with that. 
You've emphasized the need for meaningful innovation. You talked about, and these are your words, decisive portfolio and investment choices. What's your thought process about getting this portfolio back to industry growth? What's your sense of urgency? When should we think about you getting back to that low to mid-single-digit growth for this Business? 
Thanks, Alex. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alex Gorsky,  Johnson & Johnson - Chairman & CEO    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No. It's a good question. 
As we've been very open about our overall strategy for the Organization of always having a goal of growing slightly faster than our markets at a minimum. That remains our goal in MD&D. We project out that the underlying growth rate in MD&D is somewhere between 3% or 4%. We clearly want to do better than that. If I look at performance over the course of 2013, there are reasons to believe and be more optimistic about what we're seeing. 
For example, you always have to be thoughtful when you take a look at the numbers, but if we account for acquisitions and divestitures, and there was a significant swing also in the diabetes test strip, if we pull those things out, we're seeing a growth rate of about 3.2%, which we think is pretty indicative of the overall marketplace. That's in spite of a lot of churn that we've had in other areas of that business. I think as we look forward, we've talked a lot about orthopedics, what we're doing there, we're in a much better position there as we've ended 2013, and as we're setting ourselves up for the future. 
If you look at a few of the other areas in MD&D where we know we can improve performance, we're also making good progress. For example, if you look at the innovation in energy, the G2 Articulating device that we have coming out, the HARMONIC Ace +7, we think is going to have us be much more competitive. We're introducing those to the market literally as we speak. 
Biosurgicals is another area that's going to be a strong platform for growth going forward, as well. So we do think this should be a business that's growing in the area that you mentioned and that I mentioned earlier and it can be a very strong supporter overall for Johnson & Johnson well into the future. 
Obviously, we are also looking at the portfolio. I want to congratulate the work that the team did with Ortho Clinical Diagnostics and first start by thanking our employees there through this process for the great job that they've done, but also the work that the team did in working with Carlyle. We continue to look at other areas of our portfolio, as well, to make sure we're investing where we can make a big difference for patients, where we can have strong market positions that ultimately lead to future growth.

Bruce? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bruce Nudell,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bruce Nudell, Credit Suisse. Alex, two questions for you. 
Firstly, on the MDD portfolio, diabetes has clearly had a structural change. What's your thinking on that, and if in fact, that does go, does that leave a portfolio deficit, where given diagnostics departure and potentially diabetes departure, you'd like to have another growth engine there? 
Secondly, you mentioned in your comments that one of the things that J&J is focusing on is, on the Pharma side, is both commercial excellence and execution, as well as regulatory expertise. You have two great drugs, INVOKANA and Xarelto,  and they don't have big categories around them. Are those areas, of metabolic and cardiovascular, where there are very interesting assets out there that you might be pursuing? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alex Gorsky,  Johnson & Johnson - Chairman & CEO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good questions, both. First of all, let me start with diabetes. We remain committed in the diabetes space. The fact that there's over 350 million people around the world who have Type 2 diabetes. If we look at the projections going forward and the unmet medical need that exists in that space, it's important that we continue to do work there. 
Now, over the course of 2013, given some of the changes that we saw, and the over 70% reduction in some of the bidding here in the United States, we had to make necessary changes to our business model, which we did make during the course of the year. Those are always painful, but I would actually applaud the work that our teams have done in that area to quickly reorganize and focus their business. In fact, we were somewhat encouraged, even in Q4 of this year, we had growth outside the United States in our diabetes unit. 
We also started with the launch of INVOKANA this year, a very unique partnership between our LifeScan Group, as well as our Janssen Pharmaceutical Group. We jointly focused in endocrinology, and we also feel that that partnership and the broader offering that we were able to bring into that office led to the rapid uptake in endocrinology, where we actually passed JANUVIA fairly early on. We continue to maintain that. 
So long-term, obviously we're going to continue to take a hard look. We're committed to that business.  We think that overall diabetes is an interesting space, but we also recognize that we'll need to change the shape and how we function within that as we go forward. So, that would be my position on diabetes. 
Regarding INVOKANA and XARELTO, we think that these are both great products. In fact, rather than products, they're almost platforms within products. That's certainly true when you have a compound like XARELTO and the great job that Paul and his team have done on expanding the indications, rapidly getting six indications. The data that they've built, the very large clinical trial database, combined with the commercial excellence that Joaquin and his team have provided, have done a great job. We think there is further opportunities for growth there, as well. 
Certainly the same when we look at INVOKANA. We have combinations that we'll continue to work on, and there's still a lot of unmet need, and we're very early in the launch process there. But we think that overall the area of cardiovascular metabolic disease is an important one and one where we want to play.

Derrick?

Derrick Sung,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi. Thank you. Derrick Sung, Sanford Bernstein. 
Alex and Dominic, I wonder if you could spend a few moments talking a bit about what you're seeing in Europe and the utilization environment there broadly across your various businesses. You did, Dominic, call out pricing as a concern for next year, so maybe you can expand on that and give us your outlook there? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP, Finance & CFO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, just some comments on Europe. We did see some stabilization in certain parts of Europe where, as you all know, you were following, in Southern Europe, there was a significant decline in utilization. So that stabilized a bit. 
Although we don't see significant growth in utilization in those parts of Europe, and we do see, as reflected in my comments, a continued pressure on the pricing, particularly in Europe, and particularly in the regions that have had the lower utilization rates. Rather than a resurgence of growth, we see actually a continued decline due to pricing in those markets. I don't know, Alex, anything else that you want to add? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alex Gorsky,  Johnson & Johnson - Chairman & CEO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One thing that I would add is, as we look at Europe, there's a couple of ways to view it. One is clearly we saw an impact over the last few years with things like austerity measures, increased queuing in our medical devices area, and perhaps some more challenging tenders. 
But I'd also point out that if you look at the growth that we've seen in our Pharmaceutical segment in Europe over the past couple of years, it's been exceptional. What that demonstrates is that when you do bring pharmaceutical products to the market that are very differentiated, that have strong science, strong labels, good clinical dossiers, and then you match that with great account teams, great commercial presence, you can get uptake and that's what's been driving our success in that environment. 
We've got a lot of pockets. We have pockets in our Consumer area that have done very well in Europe. We have other areas in our MD&D. I mentioned the specific comments even about diabetes, given some of the challenges, how our business has done well there. Energy has done very well over the past couple of quarters there. So it's -- yes, it's a challenging environment but it's also one where you can be successful ultimately if you bring the right innovation, the right way to the market.

Okay. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David? Oh, that's Tony. 
Okay. Tony first, then David. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tony, also known as David (laughter) (multiple speakers)-- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Butler,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Tony Butler of Barclays. 
Really a question on the pre-tax margins and pharma have just been exceptional for the year. Clearly, a continuous driver of new product opportunity. The question there is are we at the goal line, or is there still more to be squeezed out on the pre-tax side? 
Second is really on the Consumer, with the increased cost of the relaunch. Is there a substantial opportunity that we can still see even in 2014 for improving pre-tax on that side? Thank you very much. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP, Finance & CFO    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony, good observation. It was exceptional growth in Pharmaceutical margins. 
I pointed out that our pre-tax operating margins this year will still expand despite the negative headwind of the impact of the yen. So that should point out that underlying growth in the business and pre-tax margins is still -- we still have that ability and we still see it. 
We don't view it as squeezing out, though, just to correct that a little bit. Because the business, as it grows, these products can generate a marginal improvement in pre-tax operating margin because of the fact that they're phenomenal products and for which they're mostly specialty products, so there isn't a commensurate increase in the level of commercial investment. Plus, the commercial teams just do a fantastic job. 
I do think there's more room there. I do -- this particular year, though, as I pointed out, it's challenged because of the impact of the yen. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Lewis,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. Alex, just a strategic question. 
Obviously for Synthes for 2014, you're pointing out as being a major strategic initiative for MD&D. You're not surprised by that. But wonder if you could help us understand, what do you see happen in 2013 and what specifically is the focus in 2014 and how it differs from 2013? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alex Gorsky,  Johnson & Johnson - Chairman & CEO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For Synthes? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Lewis,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alex Gorsky,  Johnson & Johnson - Chairman & CEO    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you take on an acquisition and integration of an enterprise that size, over $4 billion in sales, many employees, it's a complex undertaking. We knew from the very beginning that ultimately, looking at the number of people that are in the orthopedic space, looking how that space is evolving, we felt very strongly that size, the scale, that the innovation technology advantage that we'd get from bringing that together is essential for success long-term. 
But in year one, you have a lot of the nuts and bolts, frankly, of the integration. Just bringing them together on their ordering systems, getting the sales forces together, the compensation systems, common human resource programs, standardizing all of our quality, supply chain, compliance programs, all of those things were really the focus at the tail end of 2012. When you think about it, we didn't close until the second half in 2013. 
We made a lot of progress in each one of those areas. Admittedly, there's going to be some bumps in the road when you do things like that and the team went through that. But now they're focusing much more externally. 
So I would say, as we move through 2013, yes, there's still work that we need to be -- that needs to be done in bringing it together, but now the emphasis more is shifting into what does that ultimately mean for the customers. So how do we make sure that we work more broadly with the AO Foundation to ensure physicians and surgeons are getting the training and education that they desire? How can we work together even more closely in places like China, where we know that in the trauma marketplace there's a significant opportunity? 
I mentioned getting over some of the real challenges that we had in spine, bringing those two together. Frankly, in fundamentally changing this platform offering. Instead of just a knee, just a hip, just bringing a much broader portfolio approach where we see a lot of interest on the part of customers, not only here in the United States, but also globally, to fundamentally transform the model. I think that would be the fundamental shift that we're seeing. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Lewis,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very helpful. Maybe just two quick questions, Dominic, on cash. 
The first is, free cash in 2013 actually came in a little stronger than we expected of the year, so nice job there. But how should we think about free cash for 2014? Should it grow in line with earnings, faster than earnings? 
And next question is, just as we think about the divestiture of the DX business. Is the safest way to assume that that money just stays on the balance sheet for strategic alternatives, or is there a possibility we can see a dividend or a repurchase based on those, that cash proceeds? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP, Finance & CFO    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, David. 
Thanks for the comments on free cash flow. Our teams do a great job of managing, not only the P&L, but also the cash generation. If you look at our history, our free cash flow essentially equates to our earnings, within a band of somewhere between 95% to 105%. So if you're modeling it within that range, that's about what we should expect. 
Obviously, there's payments, we have to pay litigation settlements, those sorts of things, that may swing it one way or another. But that seems to be a place that we're able, through our efforts and through the teams around the world, generate significant cash flows that are essentially the same as the earnings we generate, which is a remarkable achievement. 
With respect to the OCD net proceeds, as I mentioned earlier, it's just early. We're going to evaluate how to best use those proceeds, but rest assured that as we think about how to best use those proceeds, we want to obviously offset the dilutive impact of not having the business in our go-forward results. So there are multiple ways to do that. We'll consider the best way possible. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our final question will come from Kristen. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kristen Stewart,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, it's Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Just a follow-up real quickly before a question for Alex. Just on the divestiture of OCD, could you just give us a sense in terms of what the dilution would be, just assuming cash stays on and you don't offset it, how profitable that business is? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP, Finance & CFO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, so the clinical diagnostic industry basically operates, you guys can look it up, at a margin that's below the level at which Johnson & Johnson operates in total and ortho clinical diagnostic business is consistent with those industry margins. You think about it this way, I would size it up. 
The sales of the business -- the sales are about 2.5% of our total sales. The profitability of the business is less than that because obviously it operates at a lower margin than the rest of our business. ,And if you take a half year impact from the divestiture, closing in mid-year, it's not a significant impact to the overall profitability of the Enterprise at all. So that's the way I would think about it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kristen Stewart,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then just big picture, strategically. A couple of years back, Alex, your predecessor talked about potentially -- Dominic, you were here -- adding a fourth leg to J&J. 
On one of the slides that you had today, you talked about the different areas within healthcare, and you're looking at other areas like payers and providers, and just other general healthcare indices growing much faster than the businesses that you're currently in. So how do you just overall look at the positioning of J&J and just the businesses that you're in today, adding a fourth leg, or even just prioritizing your investments within consumer, MD&D, and pharma, given the differential in growth rate? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alex Gorsky,  Johnson & Johnson - Chairman & CEO    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, we want to continue to identify and pursue areas where we think, number one, there's a lot of unmet medical need, and two, where we can work with technology and innovation to make a meaningful difference for patients and for our customers. We think over the last few years, within each sector, if you take a look at some of the investments that we've made and identified in our Pharmaceutical group, that we've done a very good job in accomplishing that and that's resulted in products like ibrutinib, some of the partnerships that we've had in other areas of our business -- XARELTO, INVOKANA -- and we would expect to continue that. And our group has done a great job of identifying those technologies very early, rapidly developing them, and bringing them to market in a great way. 
In MD&D, we've continued to innovate, but obviously we made a very big invest in Synthes, where we think size and scale is going to be important. But we're also focusing a lot on looking more broadly across our MD&D portfolio, on how we might work with customers in new and unique ways. We'll continue to look for both new technologies within the different sectors that we have in MD&D, but also for adjacencies that we think, again, help us better help serve patients, but also broaden our offerings in some cases. 
In Consumer, the team has done a great job, particularly over the past 12 months, of really better focusing the business. I mentioned that in my talk. Now, obviously, we'll take a hard look. But there, we think there are a lot of regional opportunities. We think there are other areas of the portfolio that also -- that we could augment. 
But we've also demonstrated over the past couple of years that we've done a nice job on selective divestitures, as well, to better focus on some of our efforts. So I wouldn't say that there's a fourth leg per se. But we're always looking for big areas of unmet medical need, areas that may broaden our platforms or that could provide a brand-new platform going forward.

Some final remarks from Alex. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alex Gorsky,  Johnson & Johnson - Chairman & CEO    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you very much, everyone. I'm not sure if it's snowing yet outside, but I'm sure we'll hear soon. But I'd like to end, basically, where I started this morning, and thank all of you for making the effort to be here and participating in today's meeting. 
As I said earlier in my talk, our strategic framework and our broad base of offerings, critical mass and positions really puts Johnson & Johnson in a good place to drive growth in today's marketplace. This year, we're going to work very hard on continuing to deliver new, innovative products and solutions for consumers and patients around the world, and by implementing and focusing on those near-term priorities I talked about, as well as the longer-term growth drivers. I look forward to -- and we look forward to continuing to update you on our progress against them, just as we did last year. 
I'd also like to ask you to please save the date for the Medical Device and Diagnostics Business Review on May 22, which we'll host in New Brunswick. Again, that's May 22nd in New Brunswick for MD&D review. 
Let me close by saying thank you, safe travels, and we'll look forward to seeing you next year. Bye for now.
