Presentation

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Deutsche Post DHL conference call regarding the half-year results 2015.  (Operator Instructions).
Let me now hand the floor over to Martin Ziegenbalg.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head, IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you and a warm welcome to anyone out there for our Q2 2015 results call as announced with our CFO, Larry Rosen, sitting right next to me.  So a pretty busy reporting day overall definitely in our industry.  We've got a busy set of numbers, so no time to lose and I would like to hand over to Larry right away and after that we've got time for Q&A.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great.  Thanks Martin and thanks to all of you for joining today.  I'm pleased to be here to give you an update on our mid-year progress and also to talk about our guidance for the full year 2015 and also the following years.
So turning over to page 2, for those that have the presentation.  Here's kind of the highlights for the quarter.  And the second quarter has been marked by a number of special factors which I'll review throughout the presentation.
But in any case, we're pleased with the progress we've made and the steps taken in recent months, and in Q2 in particular to position, each of our divisions for mid and long-term success with the transition over to Strategy 2020.
In Post e-Commerce Parcel, or PeP division, we were able to reach a sustainable wage agreement that secures long-term competitiveness of our German parcel business.
Nevertheless, the more than 50 days of sustained strike activity had a negative impact on our earnings of around EUR100m in the second quarter.
On the back of an unsatisfactory earnings development in global forwarding freight, the new management team -- and remember that that team has been in place since just the end of April -- has initiated a comprehensive turnaround program including restructuring measures already booked in Q2.  And I'll come back to the turnaround program in general a little bit later.
The supply chain division, supported by positive one-offs, has been able to accelerate its already planned restructuring and optimization program.
At the same time, the express division has continued its outstanding revenue and earnings development in the second quarter and was able to further improve its operating margin to a historical record high of 10.9%.
Today, as a result of the strike effect, we're adjusting our EBIT guidance for the full year by the EUR100m for the new range of EUR2.95b to EUR3.1b.  That being said, we fully confirm our guidance for 2016 and 2020.
Now, let's have a closer look at the major effects during Q2.  We'll see those on page 3.
In the PeP division, we incurred extra costs for temporary workers and reorganization of work processes to provide the least possible disruption for our customers.  But these costs were partially offset by lower wage costs for the striking employees.  So, as the employees were striking, we didn't have to pay them, still the extra costs we incurred outweighed the cost savings that we had.
A further impact was in lost revenue by customers who temporarily switched to other providers or other forms of communication.
Since the strike was ended after the first week in July, we expect an additional effect in Q3 in the low to mid double digit million range.  However, that effect is fully considered in our adjusted guidance that we communicate today.
Most importantly, the agreement we signed provides a long-term competitive wage structure for our parcel business, enabling us to continue to invest in our leadership position in the fast growing e-commerce driven parcel network.
In global forwarding freight, we took advantage of a gain on the sale of a minority stake in the Sinotrans parent company.  Not to be confused with our express joint venture with Sinotrans.  This gain was used mostly for restructuring and smaller write-offs in connection with our turnaround initiatives in the division.  They should contribute to an improved operating performance in comparison to the recent quarters.
Similarly, in supply chain we took advantage of a large gain on a real estate transaction in the UK to accelerate our already planned and communicated restructuring measures, bringing the plan benefits and step-up in operating performance even closer time-wise to us.
Now on to page 4.  The just described effects have a significant impact on our Group performance in Q2.  The second quarter saw a year-on-year increase in revenues of 7.3%.  Adjusted for positive currency effects, the organic gain would have been only 0.6%.
But that result does include the impact of lower energy costs and surcharges on a year-over year-basis.  If we would make that correction as well, our organic growth would be around 3%.
Group EBIT fell by 18% to EUR537m.  This was mainly related to the EBIT decline in PeP due to the just mentioned strike effect of around EUR100m, while EBIT in DHL was almost unchanged compared to last year.  And within DHL, we saw mixed results.  Express continued its very strong growth path while global forwarding freight EBIT continued to be weak.
Our financial result is slightly below the previous year due to some currency effects.  And the tax rate we've revised a bit downwards to now an estimate of 16.5% for the half year and now that reflects our full year estimate for the effective tax rate.
Consolidated net profit declined by around 29%.  Again mainly due to the EUR100m effect at the operating level in PeP.
Now, we'll review our guidance for the different years on page 5.
For 2015 again we now expect EUR2.95b to EUR3.1b, revising both the bottom and the top range of the band by the EUR100m effect because of the strike.
And that means that PeP is the source of the guidance change where we now forecast to have earnings of at least EUR1.2b from the old, at least EUR1.3b.  And we stay at EUR2.1b to EUR2.25b as the EBIT forecast for the DHL divisions and that remains unchanged.
The forecast for EBIT for 2015 does not include any potential and only possible non-cash write-off on IT in the DHL global forwarding freight division, which might be triggered, depending on our decision to continue with the current program or choose an alternative way forward.  We expect to be able to announce our decision on the best way forward along with a concrete timeline by the time we announce our Q3 results.
The Group expects costs for corporate center to remain stable with last year at around EUR350m.
In addition, the Group also continues to expect free cash flow to exceed the dividend that we paid in May for the 2014 earnings of about EUR1.3b.
And as mentioned, we expect the tax rate now for the full year to be 16.5%.
And gross CapEx we reconfirm the EUR2b forecast for the full year.
For 2016, we fully reconfirm our guidance to strongly increase EBIT to between EUR3.4b and EUR3.7b.
The one-time nature of the strike-related costs incurred in the current quarter, and especially the expected positive impact of structural improvements undertaken within the individual DHL divisions, should drive a much more dynamic earnings growth trend in the coming years, starting with 2016.
The PeP division is expected to contribute more than EUR1.3b to the 2016 figure and the DHL divisions EUR2.45b to EUR2.75b.
And, our guidance for 2020 is confirmed as you know it.  We continue to forecast that operating profit will increase by an average of more than 8% annually.
Now over to page 6.  We have look at our cash flow.
The development of operating cash flow before changes in working capital was driven by the decline in EBIT, but also by cash-out for one of our provisions related to the US restructuring from 2009 and also the funding of a pension liability in a controlled joint venture subsidiary.
Against that, we saw a significant improvement in working capital compared to Q2 of last year, mostly in our PeP and also the global forwarding division.
Investments were made in all four divisions with a focus on positioning the Group for future profitable growth.
Free cash flow for the second quarter declined from EUR208m to EUR67m in the current year period, and this reflects the lower operating cash flow and higher payments for capital expenditures.
Finally, please note that the gains from the Sinotrans share sale and the King's Cross sale -- that's the real estate transaction that we had in the supply chain division -- are both included in free cash flow.  You see the EUR219m of net M&A.  But because they're part of investing cash flow, they are not part of operating cash flow.  So they were in our EBIT, in our free cash flow, but not in our operating cash flow.
Now looking at page 7, you see that net debt for the Group was almost EUR3b at the end of the second quarter, which reflects the usual seasonal increase over year end mainly related to the dividend payment of over EUR1b which we made in May, but also the civil servant pension payment which we have done already in Q1.
We expect that cash flow generation in the second half will, as usual, significantly improve despite expected slightly higher CapEx spending.
Please note also that the Group's net pension obligations reduced by EUR2.7b during the second quarter compared to the prior quarter, so the end of Q1, due to slightly higher discount rates.  And one sees here finally the other side of the trend that we've been seeing for so many quarters of higher pension liabilities because of lower discount rates.  Finally in Q2 we've seen a slight reversal of that trend, but it had a huge impact on the pension liabilities of EUR2.7b.
So now on to page 8.  We'll look at the individual divisions a little more closely and we'll start with the PeP division.  Here we have the clear impact from the strike.  And I'm pleased to say that the impact on customers could be minimized to a large extent due to very good preparation and commitment of our employees that were not involved in the strike activities including, in many cases, management employees.
Nevertheless, volumes in mail communication as well as dialogue marketing declined by 5.3% and 12.8% respectively which led to a decline in revenues for those segments.  Despite these effects, we saw very good growth in our e-commerce and parcel volumes, even if we also think there was some impact from the strike on parcel volumes as well.
Remember that parcel volume growth in Germany in Q1 was 11% and only 8% in Q2.  We actually think we've lost a couple of percent growth due to the strike also in Q2, even if we still had excellent growth of 8%.
In e-commerce, we had revenue growth of over 26%, significantly benefiting from currency effects.  We had 9.3% growth in Parcel Germany and here we talk about revenue growth and also 8.6% growth in Parcel Europe compared to last year.
Now on page 9 you see that overall revenues grew for the division by 1.9% and that was mainly thanks, or all thanks, to the further dynamic e-commerce and parcel growth where the decline in our mail business could be offset.  But, obviously, we think that revenue growth would have been significantly higher without the impact of the strike.
EBIT contracted to EUR75m reflecting mainly the impact from the strike.
And the operating cash flow declined only slightly, which was the result of a very good trend in working capital, in particular, receivables, that helped to offset a large part of the EBIT decline from a cash flow point of view.
CapEx was principally directed toward expanding the domestic and international parcel infrastructure.
On to page 10.  We outline here the cornerstones of the wage agreement that we signed on July 6.  And we are pleased that we have been able to reach the agreement on both wages and working conditions with our social partner, Verdi.  In our view, it represents a reasonable solution for all parties involved.
And to just to lay out the key components for those that are unfamiliar with it, we have this year, on October 1, a one-time payment to the employees of EUR400 per employee.  Then the first wage increase on October 1 of next year with 2% and then a year later 1.7%.  The new wage contract will be valid for 32 months until January 31, 2018.
The current, or previous 38.5 hour work week, will remain unchanged and the current working regulations, including the employee redundancy protection, are extended to 2019.
There'll be no outsourcing limit for parcel deliveries within the Group companies and with that, the DHL delivery companies, the ones that we founded early this year, the 49 in Germany, remain in place.  And we expect to do further hiring of dedicated parcel delivery employees at the logistics industry tariff rate to support the dynamic parcel growth that we have in Germany.
Together, this represents a comprehensive package for all stakeholders, safeguarding PeP competitiveness and facilitating further investment and profitable growth.
So on page 11 you see a very good showcase of our international e-commerce capabilities.  That was the new collaboration signed in Q2 between DHL eCommerce and the German football club, FC Bayern Munchen, or Munich, and Alibaba, where we collaborate to launch an official online flagship store for consumers in China on Alibaba's Tmall Global, China's leading online retail platform.
More than 90m Bayern Munich fans in China will now be able to purchase official fan merchandise online from the German football club.  DHL eCommerce is providing the full range of logistics services for FC Bayern Munich merchandising in China from order management and product listing through to customs clearance, customer service and, of course, arranging local distribution.
And I think this is a great example of a collaboration that demonstrates our capabilities, not only in the PeP division, but also on a multi-divisional basis where we manage the long haul from Germany to Hong Kong through our forwarding business and warehousing in Hong Kong through our supply chain business.  So it's really a good example of what we can do in e-commerce and hope to be able to share with you many more examples of this kind in the future.
So on page 12 we see the express business.  The division was again very successful in delivering revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter.  Once again the main driver was further strong growth in the core TDI business where shipments per day rose by 8.6% compared to last year.
We estimate that growth was significantly ahead of market, driven by our focus on offering the best and fastest premium service for our TDI customers.  The slower revenue increase compared to volume growth was again almost entirely due to the lower fuel surcharge as we saw already in Q1.
And on to page 13.  Revenue in express climbed by 11.8% in the period from April to June to around EUR3.5b.  Adjusted for currency effects, the increase would have been around 2.7%, held back by lower fuel surcharges.  If we would adjust for fuel as well, the growth would have been over 7%.
EBIT increased by 13.6% to EUR376m and this was mostly attributable to profitable volume growth.  Again, the famed leverage effect in the express network.  We also saw the EBIT margin increase by 20 basis points over last year to a historical record high for the division of 10.9%.
Higher CapEx was in line with our investment plans, which I'll discuss further on the next page.
Here you see on page 14 many of the bigger investments that we're working on currently in express, which result in both higher capacity, greater network flexibility, better customer service, later pick up times and earlier delivery times and eventually, we think this will fuel even further volume growth.
Examples of the larger investments are the expansion of express hubs in Leipzig, Cincinnati, Singapore and also Brussels.  In addition, we're continually investing in modernizing and expanding our aircraft fleet.  And these network investments across all regions cement service leadership as a key driver of TDI growth.
On page 15 we turn to global forwarding and freight.  And we see that air freight volumes declined due to active yield management and a return to a very selective approach in the market where we are in a very competitive market environment.
Ocean volume was flat, mainly due to some weakness that we began to see in Asian exports.
The thorough review of EBIT performance by the new divisional management has led to a three-staged transition and turnaround agenda and I'll come back and share that with you in a couple of minutes.
The important thing is we've really begun fast and have already taken the first organizational measures and booked restructuring, or decided on and also were able to book the restructuring program that should clearly lead to more cost efficiency going forward.  And again, I'll come back to all these points in just a minute.
But first on page 16, a review of the financial performance for the division.  Revenues grew by 3.8%.  But adjusted for currency they would have declined by 1.5%.  Again, if we would then also adjust for fuel, they would have been slightly positive at about plus 1%.
Operating profit sharply declined from EUR102m in 2014 to EUR40m this year.  This was mainly due to the impact of the turnaround program, including comprehensive restructuring measures that the division is undertaking, as well as ongoing transformation costs.  In addition, there continues to be margin pressure in the overall market.  And all these effects were partly offset by the significant gain from the Sinotrans share sale.
The CapEx decrease reflects the decreased investment in NFE during Q2.
And here you see on page 17 this three-stage turnaround program that I mentioned.  The management of forwarding freight is focusing first and foremost on improving the operating performance of the business and has already introduced a number of changes to both structure and processes to address this goal.
This includes at first to re-empower the organization by giving the management of individual countries more autonomy and to enable a renewed  strong focus on customers.
Secondly, we've initiated a clear performance and cost improvement program and here we'll focus first on large and/or most underperforming countries.
And last but not least, we aim at regaining our leading position in the industry by sharpening our commercial focus and investing in the skills of our employees through our global certified training program that we already have very successfully implemented in the express division.
With the turnaround measures in execution, we'll decide on the way forward for the transformation program as mentioned earlier in the coming couple of months.
Now on page 18 we look at supply chain.  And despite a very disciplined and also very selective approach, assuming or accepting new contracts, we were able to generate EUR266m of very attractive new business during the quarter mainly in the tech, consumer and life science and healthcare sectors.
The division showed strong growth in developed markets, but also in Asia Pacific we saw substantial volume and new business growth.  So, supply chain was a bit of an outlier where we saw some softening in express volume growth.  And also in forwarding volume growth we saw very good growth in supply chain in Asia and in particular, in China.
All in all, we're on the right path towards our goal of increasing the operating margin at supply chain to between 4% and 5% by 2020 with more standardization, increased efficiency and better exploitation of economies of scale in our global businesses.
Then on page 19, we see that revenue in supply chain was almost 12%.  Revenue growth was almost 12%.  Adjusted for currency, it was only 0.7%.  But here we also had a fuel surcharge impact on the transportation segment within supply chain.
The division delivered overall an EBIT increase of over 9% to EUR119m.  And, as discussed earlier, the positive one-off from real estate-related transactions, primarily King's Cross, allowed the division to significantly accelerate its restructuring program during the quarter.
Investments are in line with last year and mainly support new contract startups.
And now to wrap up on page 20.  There's a lot of progress we've made in the first half of this year and in particular in Q2, and our strategic ambitions and also our priorities are very clearly defined in each of the divisions.
For PeP, we've successfully concluded the tariff negotiations and are now able to further drive profitable growth and investment on a sustainable and competitive wage structure.
Express is successfully driving its TDI business and the continuous network renewal and expansion is therefore a clear priority for us.
Within DGFF we're working to establish an efficient cost structure and improve customer service.  And with the short-term actions we've initiated we're expecting to improve operating performance in the near-term.  As mentioned, the IT decision, the transformation decision will also follow within the next couple of months.
And finally, for supply chain, the division's priority is to continue to execute along its restructuring and growth plan which we talked about in last year's tutorial and in earlier communications.
So, in conclusion, we saw clearly some special factors in the second quarter.  Nevertheless, we were clear that 2015 would be a year of investment and of transition from Strategy 2015 to Strategy 2020 based on the mentioned initiatives, all of which are currently in execution mode.
We remain fully confident that we're well on track towards our 2016 and 2020 targets.
Thanks for listening and we'd be happy to answer now your questions.

Stephen Furlong,  Davy Research - Analyst    [2]

Hi Larry.  Hi Martin.  I just have a question on -- I know in the Strategy 2020 there was -- one of the themes was growth in emerging markets.  That revenues would climb from 22% to 30% Group.  Can you just talk about that?  I know -- I mean it's almost like the developed markets are doing better, particularly in express, growing really well Europe and Americas.  Maybe just talk a bit about Asia Pac or China and just a comment about the macro environment there, a little bit of a slowdown and how does that affect the network which I know is global in nature?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, it remains clearly our goal to get to 30% of revenues by 2020.  If we just calculate based on what we project growth rates to be in emerging markets and other markets, mature markets, you know we get somewhere into the high 20s.  So we clearly have to take some measures.
In order to get to 30% we have to disproportionately invest in the emerging markets and that is our plan.  Long-term we think the emerging markets will be the most attractive growth markets for the future and we've recently reconfirmed as a Board the goal of 30% by 2020.
In terms of what we're seeing short-term or currently in emerging markets and in particular in China, again, we think there's been some mild slowdown.  So we're not seeing any falling off of the cliff, but we're seeing a more gradual slowdown and we could feel it in our express business and also in our forwarding business.  Again, supply chain was the outlier.
But you have to look at it relatively to the very high growth rates that we've been experiencing for many years.  We were in the double digits and then we've come to 7%.  And still a growth rate between 6% and 7% is quite more than what we are seeing in mature markets like Europe where we have 1.5% hopefully at best for this year and the US should be around 2.5%.  So still it's quite good growth and because of its size, is one of the major factors driving global economic and trade growth.  So we think it's going to be attractive for the foreseeable future.

Robert Joynson, Nomura.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Joynson,  Nomura - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, good afternoon Larry.  Good afternoon Martin.  I have three questions if I may.  One on express and two on forwarding.
If we start off with express, in TDI we saw volumes up by close to 9% and revenue up by 4%, so a yield reduction of about 5% measured in euros.  But if we split out the positive foreign exchange effects together with the negative impact of the lower fuel surcharges, could you provide an indication of the underlying yield development excluding those factors?
I'll give you the questions on forwarding now as well.  So the first question on forwarding.
You mentioned the potential for IT related write-offs, Larry, regarding the NFE project.  I appreciate it may be a little early to say, given that you're still deciding what to do.  But if the write-offs did happen, could you maybe provide some color on the potential magnitude of those write-offs, or at least help us on how to think about the moving parts there.
And the final question just on air freight in the forwarding business.  You mentioned that volumes had declined due to active yield management.  Could you maybe just provide some indication of how much remains in terms of potential for lower volumes due to active yield management going forward, if any?  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thanks.  On TDI, 8.6% was our volume growth.  3.8% was the revenue growth.  By far the biggest part of the difference was the much lower fuel surcharge.
So on yields, our revenue per shipment was slightly up.  Our revenue per kilo was slightly down.  Most of that -- most of those movements reflect mix effects as opposed to pricing deterioration, or improvement.  For the most part, pure yield effect was pretty constant in Q2, as it was also in Q1, so for the whole first half.  And that's a trend that we've been seeing for some time.  So there's some mix effect, so the continual shift from let's say flat to packages and some weight mix effects, weight per package, but those are not pure price effects.  For pure pricing effects, we've been pretty flat over many quarters now.
So in forwarding, to try to give some ideas about the magnitude of a possible write-off, again there's no decision yet that leads to a write-off and there may not ever be one depending on which alternative we pick.
What I can tell you which is factual is that the amount of investment that we've activated on the balance sheet in connection with the NFE project is around EUR300m.  A write-off of that entire amount would imply that we completely abandon all of the work that we've done so far and go to some new completely different alternative.
I would characterize the chances of doing that as likely to very unlikely -- sorry, unlikely to very unlikely.  The chance that we won't be able to use any of what we've developed so far is just very unlikely.
So one alternative is, of course, to continue on with the path that we have invested in over the last couple of years and that would of course involve no write-off.  And then there are some alternatives in between where we would use major parts of the systems that we've developed so far but might decide to no longer use some other parts and that would involve some smaller write-offs.
So it's really too early to give you more color than that, but I hope that that is helpful.
So in terms of active yield management on air freight, we've made a huge step in Q2 to pass out loss making-routes and customers, but it's possible that there's still some of that.  I think it depends a lot on what the overall market development is and if the market is improving then there'll be less need to pass out or to eliminate existing business that we have.  And then therefore there shouldn't be much of a further impact on growth rates.
If the market continues to be difficult or even worsens, then the need to be selective will continue and we'll see some continuing impact on our volume growth.  So that's the best answer I can give you on that one.

Hi Larry.  Hi Martin.  I also have three questions.  Hi.  The first one, you mentioned the softness you've seen in Asia across all segments, ex-supply chain.  Just wondering how that shifts or affects your views on the potential for trade growth in the second half in 2016 versus GDP.  Do you have a more muted expectation for the time being?  That's the first question.
Second, if we look at forwarding, given all the uncertainties in the second half and the future of the turnaround, can you talk us through the bridge for fiscal 2016?  It seems to suggest a pretty strong rate of underlying growth for supply chain.  If you could elaborate on that a bit.
And then lastly, in express you've highlighted the key hub investments.  Are any of those currently effective bottlenecks?  And can you give us some sense of what the current utilization is in your principal Asian hubs?  Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so I think that Asia, our forecast for GDP growth still remains close to 7%.  So we were probably a bit above 7% overall in the first half.  Even if we slipped slightly below it in the second half, the full year should at least round to 7% and that would be close to our expectations for 2016 as well.
So in forwarding, you know we do expect to begin to realize benefits from the organizational and process restructuring that we've done, also significantly on the cost structure from the restructuring investments that we've made in Q2.  And so we would expect already and even apart from whatever we may decide to do on the transformation side, some improvement in the underlying performance.  Maybe we'll start to see that already in the second half, but certainly we'll see it in 2016.
And even more so though, as you referred to, in supply chain where especially the ability enabled by the real estate gain that we had last quarter to even accelerate the restructuring plan for this year, allows us to realize the benefits from the restructuring even sooner and to need to invest later even less.
So we do indeed expect a significant step-up in performance in supply chain in future years.  And again that's implied by the 4% to 5% margin that we expect and have talked about for 2020.  But we already expect to see the first significant step in that direction in 2016.
So the hub and gateway investments that we're doing in express, no, there is no bottleneck that we have at the current time.  But given the continued very strong volume performance that we have, one could develop some time soon if we were not doing the investments that we're doing.
So we're trying to stay one step ahead of the game and have been successful at doing that so far and plan to remain successful at that.  But we need to invest in order to keep things going and to become even more efficient and also to improve customer service.

Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, good afternoon.  Some of my questions have already been asked, but there are one or two left remaining.
First of all, in terms of the changes in the forwarding business, can you just tell us a bit more about what the terms of reference are there, in particular both for this year and in future years?  Is there still an aspiration at some point to match peer EBIT GP conversion or has that been dropped?  And, indeed, is this business going to be measured on its standalone profitability, or what it simply contributes to the rest of the Group?
Second question really relates to tax.  The tax rate is down for this year.  What does that do to 2016 and 2017?  It looks like there's some, maybe a slight amount of more deferred tax assets on the balance sheet.  How much more are potentially activatable in future?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Thanks Damian.  Yes, so you know that our Achilles heel in the forwarding business has been in the past, EBIT conversion.  We just had too high overhead costs driven by different structures, different organizational structures around the world, but most of all by this very old and inefficient ERP system that we had.
And it was an explicit goal of the transformation to bring our EBIT conversion from what historically has been in the 15% range up to an industry-leading level, at least on par with the peers, of around 25%.  And that continues to be a very clear goal of our transformation and of our strategy for that business.
We see it as more necessary than ever as the business becomes even more competitive and there's new entrants from emerging markets.  And we think that it's crucial to be cost competitive and that continues to be a goal and objective for the business.
In terms of standalone profitability, each of our divisions is measured on standalone profitability.  And so that is true for the forwarding division as much as for PeP, or express, or supply chain.
Yes, the tax rate has been adjusted slightly downwards for the full year, 16.5%.  Our old forecast was around 18%.  I would not like to give a forecast for future years yet.  We'll talk about that when we announce our full year guidance for 2016, or reconfirm the EBIT guidance of EUR3.4b to EUR3.7b when we announce our full year results.  But, at that point, we'll also give a forecast for the tax rate and probably something about cash flow and also about CapEx.

Johannes Braun, Commerzbank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johannes Braun,  Commerzbank - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, thank you.  I just want to just double check one thing.  So in case NFE will be abandoned, and given you have included efficiency gains from this project into your 2020 guidance, how do we have to think about this long-term guidance?  Or, in other words, are you confident in reaching the 2020 targets even without NFE being implemented?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I think -- I think maybe it's semantics, but there's not an alternative by which the transformation which we've called NFE, new forwarding environment, is abandoned.  There is an alternative, again less likely than the other alternatives, but an alternative which would have us go to an alternative IT solution, IT and ERP solution, rather than the one that we've developed so far.  And that would be to write-off what we've developed so far and then the investment in a new different ERP system.  Again, this is a less likely alternative.
And -- but the idea of saying we don't need a transformation again given the discussion we had a minute ago about our disadvantage on EBIT conversion is not an alternative that we consider.  We have to do a transformation.  We have to become much more cost competitive.  We have to get our EBIT conversion to 25% at least.  And that's something that we're absolutely determined to do and we can't do that without a new IT and ERP environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johannes Braun,  Commerzbank - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is that okay, Johannes?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johannes Braun,  Commerzbank - Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I mean in any case I guess the benefits, the gains will come in little later.  So at least there will be a delay.  So I was just wondering if 2020 targets in terms of freight forwarding are still valid.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not sure -- I don't think concluding now that there's going to be a delay is something that you or we can really view yet.  It'll depend on which alternative we pick.  So I don't think it's fair, at least not yet fair, to assume that there's going to be some delay.
In any case, whichever alternative we pick, by 2020 we would expect it to have been certainly fully implemented.  And we, on that basis, are fully confident about reaching the 2020 targets for the whole Group.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johannes Braun,  Commerzbank - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Understood.  Thank you.

Neil Glynn, Credit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neil Glynn,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon everybody.  If I could ask two questions please.
The first one is with respect to express and Europe specifically.  If I look to TDI revenue, I think grew by about 4% on a 12% increase in shipment volumes.  Just looking to understand what drove the implied negative pricing dynamic.  How much of that was fuel surcharge, mix effects etc.?  And also tied to that, are you seeing many new business wins in the current environment with FedEx-TNT in prospect?
And then a second question just with respect to DGF leadership beyond this year.  How do you think about a new forwarding CEO?  And is new leadership required to definitely take the next steps before you implement a new restructuring strategy or is the current interim situation a stable enough platform on which to make all the decisions?  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Two good questions.  So I think on Europe TDI growth, I think the main difference between revenue growth and volume growth is in fact the fuel surcharge.  There are some minor mix effects, but the main factor is fuel.
And on DGF leadership I will reserve comment on that and ask you to ask that question to Frank Appel, both when we announce our Q3 results or have the press conference that day and also when we talk about, or announce, the way forward on transformation which we expect to be able to announce by that time.  And you know I think that is more something for him to comment about than for me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neil Glynn,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understood.  Okay.  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head, IR    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Thanks Neil and I think we've got time for one further caller.

Alex Paterson, Investec.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alex Paterson,  Investec - Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi there.  Can I ask two questions please?  Firstly, on slide 10, you were saying that there's no outsourcing of letter or joint delivery until 2018.  Can you just confirm that that means that you are able to outsource beyond that time without the risk of strikes?
And secondly, can I just ask in terms of your guidance, if for whatever reason NFE turns out to require a more significant change than maybe in your mind at the moment, is there a risk that your guidance for 2016 and beyond could change?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so thanks for those questions.  Yes, the no outsourcing to 2018 means for the duration of this tariff agreement which ends on January 31, 2018 that we can't do any outsourcing to external parties.  After that, our ability to outsource will be governed by a new tariff agreement which we would negotiate before the end of the current one.  So I can't answer that question yet.  It will depend on what the terms of the new agreement are.
So the comment about the potential write-off associated with NFE, depending on which alternative we pick, was meant to convey the message that it is not considered in our guidance for this year or next year.
I think the very high likelihood is that should there be, or should we pick an alternative which would involve a write-off, that that will occur this year and then we'll be done with it.  And so in any case, 2016 and beyond guidance would not be affected.
But again we should not conclude from this discussion that in fact there's going to be a write-off or that it's going to be a large write-off.  I just wanted to alert you to the fact that it's not considered in our guidance and that it's possible given the different alternatives that we're considering.

Alex Paterson,  Investec - Analyst    [38]

One more caller please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jochen Rothenbacher, Equinet Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jochen Rothenbacher,  Equinet - Analyst    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, thank you for taking my question.  I have two questions on PeP.
First of all, the minimum wage regime in Germany is now in place for more than half a year.  Could you please expand a little bit on the effects on your business from that?
And secondly, on mail pricing, it seems to be that the regulation is changing here in Germany.  So could you also shed some light on these developments?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lawrence Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure.  So on the minimum wages, of course it doesn't have any effect on our wage structure since we're already far above the minimum wage.  We do think it has an impact on one or the other of the smaller competitors who may have been below or slightly below the current minimum wage of EUR8.50 per hour.  So it may mean a slight increase in their cost structure.
Since the introduction of the minimum wage, we haven't though noticed any significant impact in the market.  So it's very hard to determine whether there's really been any impact or not.  But we haven't noticed anything.
On mail pricing, indeed, there has been a new regulation that's been passed this year that -- legislation not regulation.  Legislation that's been passed this year and indeed is now in the hands of the regulator, the Bundesnetzagentur, to determine how they interpret that and implement it.  And we're waiting for some guidance from them about that.
That being said, it potentially gives us more flexibility with regard to pricing and the timing of pricing increases.  But I think until we see something more concrete from the regulator, it would be inopportune to say more about that at this time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jochen Rothenbacher,  Equinet - Analyst    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Thank you.
