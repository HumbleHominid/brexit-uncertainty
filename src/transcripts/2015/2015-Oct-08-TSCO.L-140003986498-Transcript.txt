Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Tesco PLC Fixed Income Investor Call hosted by Alan Stewart, CFO and Shubhi Rao, Group Treasurer. During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, October 8, 2015.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Alan Stewart, CFO, Tesco. Please go ahead, sir. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks very much and good afternoon everybody. Good morning if you're joining us from -- across in the US. And thanks very much for the time. So as you know yesterday we announced our interim results for the half-year ending August 2015, and I'll just run through the key headline messages and then throw it open to questions.
So, in terms of the overall, we view the transformation that we're undergoing as being on track, and what we've seen across the Group is a broad-based improvement. If we turn into specific markets, the UK, first half like-for-like sales was down 1.1%, which is a continuing improvement. So, our Q2, while still down was a better performance than in Q1 and we continue to see that actually across all markets.
International, the first half like-for-like sales actually showed growth of 1% with both Europe and Asia positive in the second quarter. In the UK, our transactions were up 1.5% and volumes up 1.4%, clearly with our like-for-likes having fallen to deflation in the market and we see that is running somewhat above 2%. Some of that is obviously input inflation (technical difficulty).
For the half year, we recorded GBP354 million of group operating profit through the investments we're making for customers and the rebuilding of the profitability in the UK. We've moved our metrics, I'm very happy to talk to what our headline metrics are if you've got any queries on them, but in short, our operating profit metric is much more closely aligned to the actual results of the Group and we don't have -- we've dropped from our trading profit that we previously spoke about which had a number of results not included in it. So operating profit is a much cleaner measure. And we've also not got any exceptional items in the six months we've just recorded.
We're on track to deliver the GBP400 million of annual savings from our restructuring program and we've also made very good progress with our balance sheet strengthening with the sale of Homeplus in Korea and the confirmation of the closure of our UK defined benefit pension scheme from November and move to a defined contribution scheme.
We also announced that our portfolio reshaping is concluded with the sale of Homeplus. We've made a decision to retain dunnhumby and we've got a very clear focus across the Group of generating cash from our retained assets.
We've had a lot of speculation about potential asset disposals in Thailand and Malaysia and in Central Europe, and we really wanted to bring an end to that speculation. So those assets form part of the Group, our portfolio reshaping in those large markets in order to or potential reductions in our group indebtedness have now been delivered.
Homeplus will deliver proceeds of around GBP3.5 billion at the end of this month. We've had all regulatory approvals for that and we've also had shareholder approval. So we're now very clearly on a timetable to closing and receipt of the funds. Those funds were denominated originally in both dollars and Korean won and we hedge them shortly after the transaction we will receive sterling proceeds (inaudible) GBP3.5 billion.
So, overall, as we say, we are on track and we've seen a broad-based improvement across the Group. We did have a presentation yesterday, which many of you would have seen. I am very happy to take questions either on the presentation or indeed on the overall progress that we're making and -- of the balance sheet, I'm sure something you want to talk about. But, the floor is open to questions now. 


================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Audience Member    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, (Operator Instructions) Toby Hunston, Insight Investment.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Toby Hunston,  Insight Investment - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just have a -- first question, just about the proceeds split from Homeplus. Obviously, you've given some guidance. But I was just wondering if you're able to provide more of a split in terms of what will go to which you think gross debt and then if there is anything to go into either a price investment or capital investment?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. Toby, it's a great question. I should also have said as part of my introduction that I'm joined by Shubhi Rao, Group Treasurer. So, I may well bring her into the answers as well.
In terms of the proceeds, we really view -- at the moment, we haven't given a specific in terms of any investments. We have maturities of bonds, which for about a year from now in the amount of GBP1.2 billion or thereabouts. And for the moment we are certainly seeing those, and again I don't want to get calling us to what our bond market activity may or may not be. But those are maturities which we clearly have coming up under the first significant maturities we have.
So, we will have quite a lot of cash on our balance sheet because we're essentially undrawn as against our GBP5 billion facilities at the moment and from the end of this month, we'll have very significant cash in our bank accounts. The process of decisions on price investment and custom investment is something which we're very clear. Our customers will see first. So, to the extent that we have any investments in price, we will focus them through our trading activity.
What we're seeing this year is the price investment that we've made has driven sales, which have been higher than our expectations and we showed that as part of our six months update on our key measures, the big six as we call them, and wherever possible, we will use that outperformance in terms of sales to further invest in the business and in the customer offer. So, we're trying to generate funds in order to invest but clearly we've got -- if you like some firepower should we need to do more than that from a cash perspective.
The investments in the capital side of the business is something which is one of our focuses. And as you know, one of our priorities is to bring more of the properties back onto our ownership and take them out of leasehold. We will do that on a very selective judicious basis where we're clear that the returns we're getting from that investment are consistent with the right returns from the CapEx that we're doing. So we have got a small amount (technical difficulty) in terms of the investments we are making.
So, on one level, Toby, what we've got is a balance sheet, which while significantly delevered and if you take the half-year gross leverage at GBP8.5 billion, take off the proceeds from Korea, you're getting to about GBP5 billion and we gave market guidance yesterday that we would expect to generate between GBP400 million and GBP500 million of cash through the operations by the end of the year and through further working capital improvement.
So, we're looking at about on that level around GBP44.1 billion of net debt at the year-end. A lot of that is cash with gross indebtedness higher. And we'll just have to continue to look at it. So, for the moment, we don't have any specific activity highlighted. But as we go through the next period, we'll come back and talk about that more in April.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Toby Hunston,  Insight Investment - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If I could just follow (technical difficulty) just wondering what kind of incremental pricing benefit you get from your suppliers with your volumes growing at 1% or 2% versus them falling 2%, 3%, 4%. Is that kind of a meaningful benefit that you get from your suppliers or not?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Again, a great question. We certainly believe that growing volumes with our suppliers gives us the right opportunity to talk to them about the price at which we're buying the goods. I think for the moment it's been much -- there hasn't really been a great opportunity to have that discussion because we're really linking the discussion along with our category and range resets as well. So, we had a number of supplier agreements which were of a term nature. So, clearly, those have to expire. Equally, we think the better time to have discussions with suppliers around really what it is we're going to be doing from a longer-term perspective is when we go through our range resets and our category reviews. So we've done 21 of those, which is what we announced yesterday. We've got the balance to do through to the end of the financial year. And I think we'll be able to see more of that at that stage.
So for the moment there is some benefits. We've seen volumes and we spoke about the volume growth that we're seeing is primarily in the food area and we had a question at the Analyst Call yesterday as to whether it was non-food or food and for us it's strongly in food and yes, we get some benefit in that but there is clearly more to come.
Another bit of help that you might have is that if we were to -- in order to drive -- we also have asked a question as to what, at what point does price investments really drive positive like-for-like and what we saw is that we need to drive volumes up by about 4% from where we are to get to positive like-for-like and we think that the price investments on that is not the right equation to do. So we make progress in terms of competitiveness in price investments but we are doing it in a way that we're balancing the overall business performance with that customer experience.

Sunil Patel, AXA Investment Managers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunil Patel,  AXA Investment Managers - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just a clarification on your free cash flow guidance that you gave yesterday and you just repeated today. GBP400 million to GBP500 million of cash flow to be generated in H2 or is that for the full year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, exactly. So we had GBP281 million in the first half of the year. We expect everything else being equal to generate around another GBP400 million, GBP500 million in the second half of the year. Now thats what I said yesterday what that was -- as I see it now, clearly there are with volume of purchases and pay and therefore criticisms that we have against our business, there can be relatively small movements can make difference to that, but that's the best estimate we have as we go through now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunil Patel,  AXA Investment Managers - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then, just another question. In terms of on the pension side obviously the swtich from DB to DC, have you estimated the cash cost of the one-off switch cost if there is any (multiple speakers)?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just to give a bit more color on all of the pension discussions, so we went to consultation and we had some very useful feedback from our colleagues and their representatives within the discussing. And we ended up changing some of our original proposals. The final agreement and what we will be implementing does incorporate a transition payment. The terms of that transition payment for all people who are involved in the DB scheme, there will be a payment of between GBP100 and GBP500, capped at GBP500, it's equivalent to one week's wages [for both] but it will be capped at GBP500.
And that as an overall payments is factored into the guidance I've just given and it's around less than a GBP100 million is the amount. So, what we offered as well was that the colleagues will be able to elect their level of contribution and we will match that on a one-for-one basis between 4% and up to 7.5% of salary as a contribution level. Now that, at the moment obviously are unknown to us, because only once we go into the life scheme, new scheme that we'll begin to get a sense of what that level of contribution is.
So what I said yesterday that we don't expect broadly the level of cash payment, we don't know yet what the cost if you like of this new DC scheme will be compared with our DB scheme, but we didn't go into it to generate savings. We've got into, we went down those routes to secure the pension commitment that we made for our colleagues and to ensure that we had a much greater predictability over our future cash flows. So the pension trustees agreement, which is GBP270 million per annum cash funding to fund the deficits and continues and it will continue through until the next final review. Our hope and expectation is that it doesn't change at that review.
Equally importantly as part of the disposal of Korea, there won't be any further funding required of the pension fund from those proceeds, because the trustees view the covenants strengthening as being a more important than getting specific cash into the scheme, and that was all something which again was one of the market questions as to how much of any of the proceeds will need to go off to pay off the pension deficit. So we've got a bit of uncertainty as to where exactly colleagues [pay cap] is, but we've got pretty good understanding of where the cash flows are as regard to pension change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunil Patel,  AXA Investment Managers - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And last one from me. Just in terms of property values, can you remind us based on, in terms of taking -- potentially taking impairments writedowns at full year, is there some reason why this wasn't on a half-year given where we see the market in terms of operating performance of [this year's] markets?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Well, again, really good question. So, where we are is that we clearly have took very significant write down and did an exercise across the whole of the Group at the end of February. The test just to remind you either comparison of carrying value in our accounts needs to be compared with two elements, the discounted future cash flows expected from the assets and the market value of the assets. And if the higher of those two is lower than the carrying value that we carrying the asset type, then we have a write-down, and we write-down to that higher level.
Some of our write-down at the full-year was linked to cash flows and some of it was linked to property values. For the moment, we don't see any need to have any further write-downs but clearly, this will be tested again at the full year and whatever the full year property values are, there may be some further write-downs. But for the moment, we haven't seen any change in those assets, but it's subject to further full review at the full year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Audience Member    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for having separate FY call. Just a couple of things. If you signal that the asset review is finished and I think there was an internal interview that you gave on the website that suggested you're going to keep Thailand and Eastern Europe. So, does that mean we should expect no disposals moving forward other than perhaps some development sites or does the end of that review mean you know what you would like to sell given a decent offer? That's question number one.
And then, number two would be, the guidance you've given spoke to a maximum -- effectively GBP940 million underlying operating profit for this year. That's about I think a GBP0.65 increase on a year-on-year basis for H2 '16 profits. Some of that improvement obviously (inaudible), some cost savings, some performance improvements. I know you probably can't provide a profit bridge. Could you probably break down this proportions you think you'll see for both, if it's a third, a third, a third or whatever you're comfortable with?
And then, the final question would be on leverage, just to check off some basics. So allowing for the pro forma disposal of Korea, we're looking now last 12 months net adjusted leverage around 5.4 times, is that right? And if we then make the assumption that you hit your guidance for sort of GBP940 million operating profit at the end of the year (technical difficulty) rents and depreciation and take into account what you just told us on cash flows, then that gets us to just under five times net adjusted leverage. That's the three questions from me.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shubhi, you want to take the leverage first and I will come back with the disposals and the first half, second half split?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shubhi Rao,  Tesco PLC - Group Treasurer    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So, you're right. On our pro forma basis, where we are, it gets us to about 5.5 times. If we're just looking on the full growth adjustment of the cash against our net debt, we should see an improvement. I think yesterday Alan said in the Analyst Meeting that what we would expect is our desire to operate in the investment grade to the timing to move about 18 months from our initial thinking. So, you are right. It is about five times.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So, just to be clear, using your numbers and the market numbers that we've spoken about, but I think what Shubhi is saying is that wouldn't disagree with those calculations of those numbers. And the benefit we get from Korea we think brings, depending on which agency you look at, brings forward the potential and investment grade metrics by 12 months to 18 months. So, we clearly -- we do expect and would desire to be operating as investment grade credits. We're not putting a fixed time on that but that remains our intention as a business and as a board.
In respect of the question on disposals, just to be -- I'm absolutely clear, we will not be disposing off the Thai-Malaysian business, North and Central European businesses. We want all the speculation around those to come to an end because those businesses have faced very significant press speculation, none of it driven by any of our activity, other than the general knowledge that we were undertaking a full strategic review of the business with the intention of significantly reducing the leverage and strengthening the balance sheet. So, those disposals -- those businesses are not up for disposal.
Coming to this first half, second half split, we haven't given it in the bridges that you described but I think the key elements I'd point to is that in the UK business, we've highlighted that the benefits from our restructuring program and most of the restructuring is in UK benefit. Those we expect -- we're on track with those and clearly those started during this -- we announced them at the end of April with our results and they were booked in the February results but a number of the people only really left the business at the end of May (technical difficulty) go through the rest of the year. We've had an outflow of around GBP400 million of the payment against the GBP600 million or so that we anticipated. So there's some element of payment and benefit still to come through.
So we -- plus we've got the momentum in the UK business which is coming off a base of zero. In the first half, the UK and Irish businesses made GBP106 million from a loss last year in the UK business. So we expect to see some improvements, and then continuing improvement through trading activity and also through savings in the second half.
The other element is clearly the international business and the European restructuring under one management team is really showing very, very strong and positive signs of benefit, again from a cost perspective, but also from a trading perspective, we're seeing growth in market share in our Malaysian and Thai businesses. So we expect to see improvement really in our two core segments, the UK and Irish business and the international business in the second half of the year. And that really underpins the market view that we've said that we will aim to get to GBP940 million which is a like-for-like, the same as last year, adjusting for Korea and the movement from trading profit to operating profit.
And we've also -- but just to remind everybody, we've also said that it's the right thing to do for the business and we need to do it or we always we choose to do it to invest and gain further competitive advantage, then we will continue to invest in the business. So I think the market view of that GBP940 million is that it's very much viewed as an aspiration, but we will reserve the right to if it's the right thing for the business or we need to do it to invest further in the offer. But that's really the shape, it's a broad-based recovery across the two most important parts of our business.

Thierry Anid, Barclays.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thierry Anid,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just had a question on your new supplier terms that you've announced. (inaudible) your working capital won't be affected. So better returns for smaller supplier means worst terms for bigger supplier. Can you give us more color on that and as well on the rationale of the whole change in supplier terms?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So what we've announced is that it's a harmonization of terms across the whole of our business. This is the UK that we're talking about, and we've looked at it category by category and what we've -- essentially we've taken the view that if you're a large supplier, then we will have different terms than if you are a small supplier. So if your turnover [with assets left in hundreds thousand a year], we will pay you within 14 days. If your turnover is at the very large end, then we will pay you, we will extend your terms somewhat and in the middle we are harmonized at a constant and consistent days as well.
We set out to do this, not to gain a working capital advantage, but in order to be clear with our supplier that these are our terms. And it's again consistent with the message that we spoke about in April that we are moving from more than 20 different ways of agreements with our suppliers to five and then ultimately to three by the end of next year in terms of the ways in which we will commercially reach agreements with you. 
So, by harmonizing the days, we're giving benefit to small suppliers, we're seeking benefit, some benefit from large suppliers. Net-net, no change. There may be a little bit of -- and we spoke about this yesterday, there maybe a little bit of disruption and timing differences around those movements, because clearly we need to start talking to our supplies, particularly those where we are seeking lengthening of terms. We haven't got agreement for that, but this is our best estimate of where we will end up and we expect that they'll be no net-net at the end -- by June next year, there will be no impacts on our working capital.
The reason that we've taken nine months to June next year is that we want to have supplies who are facing longer terms to have time to work into that. We're also obviously then starting discussions with our supplies about the term that they get from their -- that they give to their suppliers, because what we find is that those are very often much longer terms and what that is for their account equally, we need to ensure that to the extent that we can help in turn consistency on those that we achieve it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thierry Anid,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On those discussions, where they done in conjunction with the range reviews or its two different discussions?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very good question. Some and some. In essence, they are -- they may well be linked, but they're not necessarily linked because some of the range views have already happened. What we're seeking to do is to get all of these agreed by June next year.

					(inaudible), JP Morgan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Audience Member    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have two questions please. The first one is around the rents. Would you be able to share with us what would be the pro forma annual rent expense for South Korea deal and the property deals that you've done and also the present value of the leases as well please?
And the second one is on working capital, would you be able to tell us how much working capital swing or rather I believe do you expect in the second half of the year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As regard the Korean operating leases, what we've highlighted is an GBP874 million pro forma adjustment. Now, that's at February. That's what we've highlighted clearly at the time we sell the business and as time passes, some of the lease liability unwinds. But that's the number that the pro forma as of February, GBP874 million.
In respect of the working capital, we haven't given a disclosure of that GBP400 million, GBP500 million between working capital and the balance. And I think we'd rather come back to that when we gave you the bridge in April.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Audience Member    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. And regarding the British Land deal, I guess the amount is fairly small. So (multiple speakers) impact on this?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, British Land in terms of -- it brought GBP460 million on to the balance sheet. And I'm just looking to (inaudible) there were three elements to it. There was an element of debt brought on, GBP90 million received and operating lease commitments reduced.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shubhi Rao,  Tesco PLC - Group Treasurer    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By [200 something].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shubhi Rao,  Tesco PLC - Group Treasurer    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[2.4, I think].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I think on the total indebtedness basis, the British Land deal and I'm sorry this isn't going to be exactly a like-for-like with how we presented yesterday, but the British Land deal, net added just under GBP200 million of indebtedness when you take the element of bank debt brought on GBP90 million of cash and operating leases relieved.

(inaudible), Fidelity Management and Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Audience Member    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for taking my questions. A couple from me. In H1 you had a very good kind of underlying working capital performance (inaudible) your stock base. Beyond H2, in future years, what prospects do you see for further working capital improvement? And then secondly, you suggested that you thought that Southern South Korea would accelerate (technical difficulty).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(technical difficulty) and let Shubhi answer the second one. In terms of working capital, again we haven't highlighted, but what we have said is that we believe that there is scope and significant scope for working capital improvement and it won't really come in the second half of this year. We think that as the business becomes more efficient and this really links into the stop turn and the amount we order relative to what we're setting and the rate at which we're setting, we think that there is, over the next periods, scope for further working capital improvement. We haven't highlighted that.
What we've reminded people is that within our three-year plan, there are targets for cumulative cash generation, which is our cash and retail operations plus working capital, which includes working capital. Obviously, those targets will need to be adjusted once -- because of the disposal of Korea, but the principle remains that we are seeking to generate working capital plus cash from our trading activities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shubhi Rao,  Tesco PLC - Group Treasurer    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So on your second question, when you think about the impact on the adjusted net debt, there will be (technical difficulty). One will be just the proceeds we'll be receiving, as well as the impact on the operating leases. And so I don't have the assumptions you have in your number, but we would say that would be a tune of 0.7 to 0.8 by our calculations. Again, just to reiterate, that definitely helps move the target by 10 months, but I won't state the timeline around that, but do agree with your -- with the broader calculation that you have, but more than happy to take it offline if that's easier.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew Brennan,  Brown Shipley. - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Alan, thank you for taking my question. Most of them have been answered, I've just got one remaining. Just around the so-called living wage or the increase in the national wage in April, what sort of effects A, it will have on your operations, and B, on pricing in general, inflation in the supermarkets?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. This is obviously a very topical question and topical issue for us. So I think there's been kind of a coverage of the ITT Conference the day before. And some of that has, I'm afraid, not fully what was discussed and what was said hasn't fully made its way into the media. So there was a lot of discussion around GBP500 million as being the cost to us.
The background to that is that what Dave said at the IGD was that, if you were to take a simplistic view and to move from the current level of minimum wage through to the national living wage of GBP9 by 2020, then on the face of it, the GBP7.30, which is both of us today, through to the GBP9 would cost GBP500 million for Tesco in terms of the impact.
But much more importantly for us is that today we are above the national living wage, which is partly why we supported the move to the GBP7.30 that we have and these are out of London numbers. London is slightly different, but we actually pay GBP7.39 today compared with GBP7.20 I think it's what's the proposal. But much more importantly, our colleagues receive a number of other benefits, which we need to -- and they value these and they tell us that they value them, which when you put the value of them into the equation, we're at GBP8.78, which is significantly above the recommendation of what the target is and pretty close to where the target would be even by 2020.
So for us the discussion should be much more about a broader discussion as to what is that the people want and how do we deliver that to them. And we're in discussions with the union representatives at the moment around that. And one of the things we're talking about is, would people be interested in being able to have a perhaps more choice around some of those benefits as to how they take them.
So I think it's clearly an issue. We believe that it's not for us as a simple as just talking about the headline rates because that's not what people want, but it's something which we will continue to engage with the debates. But today we're about where it is and that's on the opposite value and also significantly above, look at this in terms of the overall value that our colleagues are receiving from the benefits.

Just one question for me. Have you provisioned any litigation or fines that may come at year end and has this been forecasted in the guidance?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, we haven't. And again, there's been some media comments and we continue to cooperate fully with the FFO, we've got no provisions made and we've got no reason to, and we can't really say much more than that. So right now, we haven't.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, sorry I joined this call a little bit late, but I was on the call yesterday, so hopefully you haven't already addressed these questions, but I do have a couple. The first one relates to the retail free cash flow generation that you provided a very helpful slide on in your presentation and you provided a similar slide in the fixed income investors presentation for the year-end as well. So here's my question, it's on cash taxes and cash interest. I don't understand, you've said you're not paying any cash taxes this year throughout the Group. So that GBP226 million that you recognized is only for cash interest, but that number seems quite low even for cash interest. So can you please give me a sense for what your full year cash interest is expected to be? That's my first question.
And then on cash taxes, you said that whether you pay cash taxes in the next year or not sort of depended, I assume depends on the underlying level of UK profitability, but if you could just, perhaps, expand on that a little bit?
And then sorry, there is one more question and that has to do with your restructuring payments. You paid out GBP400 million odd in restructuring out of your total of GBP600 million. Should we assume that the remainder is paid out in the second half of the year that -- I think that's my three questions. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Obviously, we'll focus in the -- of the discussion. In terms of the restructuring, we haven't specifically spoken about where the -- how much of the balance would be paid out of the roughly GBP600 million or so that we highlighted as cash payments, but I wouldn't expect to be carrying many provisions into next -- through the balance sheet date at the end of February. So most of the payments would have flowed through by that period. And that's factored into what we're talking about in terms of the expectations for cash.
In terms of the tax payments, there clearly are some timing differences as to what we pay and when we get refunds back in respect of overpayments, but clearly next overall for the Group (technical difficulty) cash element of tax. What I said was that we'd come back to guide about tax rates at the full year looking forward and clearly at that stage, we'll give some further comfort and guidance around -- it's the difference between -- significant difference between the rate of tax that's going through the P&L and the rate of tax that's going through the cash -- the cash line. So we'll come back to that.
In respect of the first timing issue, I think probably what I would suggest is that, if you wouldn't mind that we rather than go through the detail here, we can take it offline and try and work out what is there because there may be timing differences there as well, we'll take that offline?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beth Fusco,  Cairn Capital Limited - Analyst    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the cash? Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [47]

Yes, exactly.

Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow up, Alan on something you mentioned during this call and also in yesterday's call. You said that the disposal of the South Korean business will bring forward Tesco sort of, shall we say, upgraded to investment grade by 12 months to 18 months. I'm just wondering what that is based on, is that based on conversations with rating agencies, just because it kind of implies you have an idea of when you would be upgraded to IG, so I was wondering if you could maybe share that with us?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No. What we've done is clearly we run our own internal metrics based on what we think and we also have advisors who run those metrics for us. So I should maybe have made it clear that those are -- that's our estimate and it's without discussion view with the rating agencies. They have their own views and their own models, we seek to understand those as best we can. But that's very much our view. It differs agency by agency, which is why I spoke about the 12 months to 18 months range. So we don't have that expectation, if you run the numbers, as we see them and holding everything else equal, the numbers would indicate a -- bringing forward by 12 months to 18 months of the conditions under which a re-rating could be achieved.

Hi, thanks a lot for taking the follow-up question. I just had a similar hypothetical scenario, but just in light of the comments around the -- potential asset disposals, they're all done and finished. I guess, in the case where 2016 or 2017 in the UK business doesn't go quite to plan in terms of margins for whatever reason, what would be kind of the next lever that you would pull in terms of if leverage did kind of start going in the wrong direction again? Would it be -- would you come back to asset sales or would it be a rights issue, what's the kind of the waterfall of options there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Toby, I'd rather not be drawn into how -- what they would be, rather which order we would necessarily look at those options but the options are pretty clear and you've sort of covered them in terms of asset disposals or seeking to (inaudible) neither of those are what we see as necessary at the moment. We clearly see that the self-help is the right way forward, generating cash from our retained operations and generating and really focusing on cash generation, combined with continued tight CapEx control. So that's really where we're focused. And given that you've spoken about it, there has been today to my mind, probably more speculation of rights issue than any of us would have expected given what we've spoke about yesterday. And just to be clear, that rights issue isn't something we look to at the moment; we don't see it as something which is necessary. We're really focused on running the businesses that we have and we retain and running them better and more efficiently. So despite what you might read in the press this morning, that's not something that we have any real contemplation of at all.

The last update I saw suggested corporate liquidity is actually pretty good at Tesco, sort of reducing the need to come to the bond market. Can you give us an update on that, i.e., cash and available committed credit facilities that have got no covenants against debt maturities over the next few years, for example, if you've got at hand?.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've got GBP5 billion of facilities and those are a mixture of bilaterals and RCF spread over a wide range of issue as we just renewed -- extended by that year, so we had GBP5 billion plus GBP1 billion plus GBP1 billion on the RCF we just extended by a year and so --.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shubhi Rao,  Tesco PLC - Group Treasurer    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then we have the bilateral.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then we have the bilaterals as well. So I think from memory there I think 2.6 and 2.4. 2.6 of RCF and 2.4 of bilaterals, which were -- which are three-year bilaterals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Audience Member    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And all undrawn?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shubhi Rao,  Tesco PLC - Group Treasurer    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All undrawn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Audience Member    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then in terms of cash towards that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other than cash -- cash within the balance sheet, not significant, but whatever there is within our business, so. But liquidity is really not an issue for us at all. It's never been our issue. So you're right, it's never been our issue. Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Audience Member    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's good to see those extended recently as well. Thank you. Then just a follow-up on that. Correct me if I got this wrong, but I think you said you would look to do something to get you to investment grade quicker, but (technical difficulty) cost and the sustainability of refinancing, i.e., actually when you need to refinance. What are the benefits do you see of being investment grade versus that will be plus ahead of needing to refinance?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's a good question and I think from an overall perspective, clearly, if you are holding our credit and then it would be great if we would refinance -- rewrite it. But for us, the important things are liquidity, the access to the market should we need it. And the overall covenant and perception of that covenant from all constituents and those constituents are obviously the holders of the credits, but others as well including trading partners, pension fund trustees, all of those constituents. So I think there is certainly no driving needs that I see to get us to investment grade and for assets, it's more about what is the -- what are the drivers for that. And I think it's fair to say that the biggest and most clear driver of investment grade re-rating is business performance improvement. And the largest business is the UK business. The international businesses are now around 20%, 21% of our revenues. So the largest business is now the one which will drive the biggest performance. It's also the business which is performing, I'm sure we say, that is well. So in that sense we've got a very strong driver which is good as long as we deliver that performance. But there is no imperative from our perspective to seek an investment grade rating now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shubhi Rao,  Tesco PLC - Group Treasurer    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And I think also from a priority perspective, our second priority is to strengthen and protect the balance sheet and so clearly the operational performance as it helps to strengthen the balance sheet, then you would hope that the byproduct of that should be the improvement in the rating. So I think that's the order, it's how we see the re-rating action.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Again, a great question, and we had no questions on dividend yesterday. So there is a clear understanding as to where we are in the dividend. I think we need to be very clear as regard to the free cash flow generation, the business performance, the fact and root towards an upgrade in the re-rating. I've always been clear that one doesn't necessarily come before the other in either direction, but it will come at a right time from a business performance and an overall credit metric perspective, but there is no pressure at all from shareholders as of now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Beth Fusco,  Cairn Capital Limited - Analyst    [73]

Hi just one follow-up question. When do you expect CapEx to exceed depreciation as you can't run like this forever?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Stewart,  Tesco PLC - CFO    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't know the answer. Our depreciation is running at about GBP1.5 billion and our CapEx is running at GBP1 billion. I think the way you'd phrased the question. it would be a long time, because clearly CapEx depreciation has been built over a number of years and will take some time to run-off therefore. Equally the new CapEx we're putting on is building. So I think the depreciation will exceed CapEx likely for longer. Now, we haven't given guidance on CapEx beyond the current year. What we have said about the current year is that it's less than GBP1 billion. What we've also said is that we will continue to have strong discipline around CapEx as we go forward and CapEx is clearly a key part of our free cash flow calculation because it's free cash flows after CapEx, the way that we show it. So we will continue to be disciplined on it. We will do the right thing for the business. And we're very careful and cautious that we are not under investing in the business in terms of the customer experience in all aspects. So it's a great question. But for the moment I think that the depreciation is likely to exceed the CapEx.
