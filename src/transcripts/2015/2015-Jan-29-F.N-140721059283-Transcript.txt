          Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Today we are going to review our fourth quarter and our full year 2014 financial results. We will also update our view of the business environment for 2015 and also our guidance for the year ahead. So let's get right into the first slide.
Our results this quarter and for the full year reflect our continued focus on our ONE Ford Plan, which remains unchanged. Our plan has served us well and will continue to do so going forward. We are now building on our success by accelerating the pace of progress throughout our business.
We are starting to see the full benefits and strength of ONE Ford and we intend to maximize these opportunities going forward. Here at Ford, we are passionate about product excellence and leading in innovation, and we are absolutely committed to building on our product strength today with even more new products and innovations that will deliver growth for our stakeholders and define our company going forward.
Now let's turn to slide 2 for a look at the fourth quarter and the full year. The fourth quarter was our 22nd consecutive profitable quarter. Automotive operating-related cash flow was positive and liquidity remains strong. Fourth quarter wholesale volume and company revenue were lower than a year ago by 2% and 5%, respectively.
Looking at the business units, North America and Asia-Pacific were profitable and Ford Credit once again delivered strong results.
For the full year, the Company delivered its fifth consecutive year of pre-tax profit and positive Automotive operating-related cash flow, and the results were consistent with guidance. North America was profitable, and we achieved a record profit in Asia-Pacific. Ford Credit's profit was its highest since 2011. And while we reported losses in other business units, Europe and Middle East and Africa improved from a year ago.
Volume was about equal to a year ago, while company revenue declined 2%. And we achieved record market share in Asia-Pacific, driven by record share in China.
Our global pension plans were underfunded by $9 billion at the end of 2014, which was unchanged from 2013 despite significantly lower discount rates.
For 2015 our Company outlook for pre-tax profit, automotive revenue, and operating margin is unchanged from our September Investor Day guidance. And we expect Company pre-tax profit to range from $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion, with Automotive revenue and Automotive operating margin higher than 2014, which is largely driven by our new products and capacity. Today we are improving our outlook for Automotive operating-related cash flow from positive to higher than 2014.
Before getting into the financial details, I would like to take you through some of our other achievements in 2014, which you'll see on slide 3.
We launched 24 all-new or significantly refreshed products globally last year. These included the all-new F-150, which was awarded the Truck of Texas and named the North American International Auto Show Truck of the Year earlier this month. Deliveries and sales began in December.
The launches  also included the all-new 50th anniversary Mustang, Escort, Ka, Transit, and Lincoln MKC. Our best-selling midsized SUV, the Ford Explorer, debuted its new look at the LA Auto Show and will be available to customers in markets around the world later this year. We also revealed the all-new Ford Everest in Asia-Pacific.
Ford remained the best-selling vehicle brand in the U.S. and the best-selling automaker in Canada for the fifth year in a row. This was supported by continued strong sales of F-Series, which despite the downtime on F-150 to support the new vehicle launch, achieved U.S. truck sales leadership for the 38th straight year and U.S. vehicle sales leadership for the 33rd year in a row. We also set U.S. sales records for Fusion and Escape.
In Europe, we remained the number two vehicle brand -- selling vehicle brand and continue to progress our transformation plan, achieving a year-over-year share gain for the Europe 20 market for the first time since 2009. We also closed our Genk, Belgium plant, improving our capacity utilization.
Our growth in China continued with a record 1.1 million wholesales in 2014. In addition, our Changan Ford joint venture opened two new plants and we launched Lincoln in China with the first nine Lincoln dealerships which began sales of the Lincoln MKZ and MKC.
Consistent with our plan to provide regular and growing dividends that are sustainable over an economic or business cycle, we increased our 2014 quarterly dividend by 25%. And as you know, we announced an additional 20% increase earlier this month. We also completed our share repurchase program that reduced our diluted shares by about 3%.
Now I would like to turn it over to Bob who will take us through the financial results. Bob?

Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank, Mark, and good morning everyone. Let's start on the top of slide 4 where you will see that fourth quarter wholesale volume was 1.6 million units; that was down 30,000 units from a year ago. And revenue was $35.9 billion; that was down $1.7 billion.
Pre-tax profit was $1.1 billion, excluding special items; that was $197 million lower than a year ago. After-tax earnings per share at $0.26 were $0.06 lower.
Net income attributable to Ford, including pre-tax special item charges, was $52 million. This was $3 billion lower than a year ago, including a non-repeat of a favorable $2.1 billion special tax item that we benefited from last year. Earnings were $0.01 a share and that was down $0.74.
Pre-tax special item charges were $1.2 billion in the quarter, reflecting primarily a one-time loss resulting from a change in how we account for our Venezuela operations, as well as separation-related actions in Europe and Asia-Pacific to support our transformation plans, and charges associated with the settlement of our 2016 convertible notes. You can find additional detail on the special items in Appendix 3.
Automotive operating-related cash flow was $500 million and Automotive gross cash was $21.7 billion, exceeding debt by $7.9 billion. In the full year our operating effective tax rate, which isn't shown, was 35%. For 2015 we expect the rate, which excludes the profits of our unconsolidated subsidiaries, to be about equal to our 2014 rate, assuming extension of U.S. research credit legislation in the fourth quarter.
Full year vehicle wholesales were about equal to a year ago, while Company revenue decreased by 2%. Full year pre-tax operating profit, excluding special items, was $6.3 billion and, as Mark said, in line with guidance. The result was a decline of $2.3 billion from a year ago and net income was $3.2 billion, which was $4 billion lower than a year ago.
As shown on slide 5, both of our sectors, Automotive and Financial Services, contributed to the Company's fourth quarter and full year pre-tax profits. Company fourth quarter and full year pre-tax profits were lower than a year ago, more than explained by Automotive. Compared with third quarter, Automotive was favorable while Financial Services more than explained the $60 million decline in profit.
The key market factors and financial metrics for Automotive business in the fourth quarter are shown on slide 6. As you can see on the far left, wholesale volume and revenue declined 2% and 5% from a year ago, respectively. The volume decline is more than explained by North America, while the revenue decline reflects all business units. About half of the revenue decline is attributable to unfavorable exchange.
Global industry SAAR is estimated at 90.2 million units; that was up 2% from a year ago. Ford global market share is estimated at 6.9%, down 0.2 percentage points due to North America.
Operating margin was 2.8%, down 0.4 percentage points from a year ago, while automotive pre-tax profit was $713 million and that was down $250 million. The decline in both metrics is more than explained by North America.
As shown in the memo below the chart, full year volume was about equal to a year ago, while Automotive revenue was down 3%, more than explained by lower volume from consolidated operations, and unfavorable exchange with the exchange effect accounting for nearly 60% of the decline.
Operating margin of 3.9% was down 1.5 percentage points. Total Automotive pre-tax profit at $4.5 billion was down $2.4 billion. The lower results were driven by the Americas. All other business units improved.
We have included full year key metrics and year-over-year variance slides for the Automotive sector and each of our business units in the appendix.
As shown on slide 7, the $250 million decline in fourth quarter Automotive pre-tax profit was driven by higher costs and unfavorable exchange. Higher net pricing in all regions except Asia-Pacific was a partial offset, and as shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was about equal to third quarter.
The absolute fourth quarter pre-tax results for each of Other Automotive operations as well as other automotive are shown on slide 8. As you can see, North America and Asia-Pacific were profitable, while the other business units reported losses.
On slide 9 we show the factors that contributed to the $2.4 billion decline in total Automotive full year pre-tax profit. The decline is more than explained by higher costs including warranty, unfavorable exchange, and lower volume, including product launch effects and supplier part shortages. Higher net pricing was a partial offset.
The absolute full year pre-tax results for each of our Automotive operations, as well as Other Automotive, are shown on slide 10. As you can see, North America was profitable and Asia-Pacific delivered a record result. Middle East and Africa was about breakeven, while Europe and South America incurred large losses as expected.
Now we will look at each of the regions within the Automotive sector, starting on slide 11 with North America. North America fourth quarter wholesale volume and revenue were down 5% to 6% from a year ago.
While North America continued to benefit from robust industry sales, our strong product lineup, continued discipline in matching production with demand, and a lean cost structure, our fourth quarter results were affected adversely by the lower volume. This reflects lower market share and lower dealer stock increases than a year ago, offset partially by higher industry sales including the U.S. SAAR of 17.2 million units, 1.2 million units higher than a year ago.
Our U.S. market share deteriorated 1.1 percentage points to 14.3% and that was largely retail related. This primarily reflects a lower F-150 share as we continued to balance share with transaction prices and stocks during the transition to the all-new F-150.
Shares were also lower for several other products at the end of their product cycles as we transitioned to the new products launched either in the fourth quarter of last year or early this year. As shown in appendix 8, our U.S. retail market share of the retail industry was 12.8%. This was down 0.9 percentage points from a year ago, mainly reflecting the factors I already cited. The decline in North America's revenue is explained by the lower volume.
North America operating margin was 7.4%, down 0.8 percentage points from last year, and pre-tax profit was $1.5 billion, down $252 million. As shown in the memo below the chart, all full year metrics declined from a year ago. The change in financial metrics is more than explained by lower volume and higher warranty costs, including recalls.
Operating margin was 8.4%, which was slightly better than our guidance.
On slide 12 we show the factors contributing to North America's lower fourth quarter pre-tax profit. The decline is more than explained by the impact of new product launches in the quarter on volume and cost. Higher net pricing, including for new products, and lower warranty costs were partial offsets.
As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was higher than third quarter, more than explained by lower warranty costs and favorable market factors. Higher structural costs, including the effect of new product launches, was a partial offset.
Now let's turn to slide 13 and review South America, where we are continuing to execute our strategy of expanding our product lineup, including replacing legacy products with global ONE Ford offerings. We are also continuing to manage the effects of slowing GDP growth, lower industry volumes in our larger markets, weaker currencies, high inflation, as well as policy uncertainty in some countries.
In the fourth quarter, wholesale volume and revenue decreased from a year ago by 2% and 9%, respectively. The lower volume is more than explained by an 800,000 unit decline from last year's SAAR of 6.1 million units, reflecting primarily the impacted import restrictions in Argentina and the weaker economy in Brazil.
South America market share at 9.4% was up 0.9 percentage points, reflecting primarily the new Ka, which was awarded the most sought after car of the year award in Brazil from leading magazine Auto Esporte. Focus also contributed to the share improvement.
The revenue decline is more than explained by weaker currencies and unfavorable volume and mix with higher net pricing as a partial offset. Operating margin was negative 7.6%. This was down 2.9 percentage points from a year ago and pre-tax loss was $187 million, a deterioration of $61 million.
As shown in the memo below the chart, all full year metrics deteriorated from a year ago, driven by unfavorable changes in external factors. The full year loss includes $426 million of adverse balance sheet exchange effects related primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuela bolivar in the first quarter.
On slide 14 we show the factors contributing to the decline in South America's fourth quarter pre-tax results. Higher warranty costs, including the field service action, more than explained the deterioration compared with both the prior year and third quarter. The adverse effects in the quarter of weaker currencies and high local inflation were nearly offset by higher net pricing. Also note that the share growth from new products offset the industry decline.
All right, let's now turn to Europe, beginning on slide 15, where we continue to implement our transformation plan focused on product, brand, and cost.
Europe's wholesale volume improved 5% from a year ago while revenue declined 2%. The higher volume is more than explained by a 500,000 unit increase in Europe 20 SAAR to 15.1 million units and a lower dealer stock reduction compared with a year ago. The focus on product and brand saw continued progress in the quarter, with launch of the new Focus and all-new Mondeo.
Our Europe 20 market share improved 0.2 percentage points to 7.6%, driven by a 2.8 point improvement in our commercial vehicle share to 11.7%, reflecting the success of our full line of new transit vehicles and continued strong performance of the Ranger compact pickup. The decrease in Europe's revenue is more than explained by unfavorable exchange.
Europe's operating margin was negative 6.5%, an improvement of 1.1 percentage points from a year ago, and pre-tax loss was $443 million, an $86 million improvement. As shown in the memo below the chart, all full year metrics improved from a year ago.
Slide 16 shows the factors that contributed to the improvement in Europe's fourth quarter pre-tax results. The improvement is more than explained by favorable market factors offset partially by Russia. As shown in the memo below the chart, pre-tax results were about equal to third quarter despite the impact of Russia.
Let's now turn to slide 17 and review Middle East and Africa, where we are focused on building our distribution capability, expanding our ONE Ford product offering tailored to the needs of markets in the region, and leveraging global low-cost sourcing hubs for vehicles in this fast-growing part of the world.
Middle East and Africa's wholesale volume and revenue declined 10% and 2%, respectively. The lower volume primarily reflects an unfavorable change in dealer stocks to align with near-term market demand.
Operating margin was negative 8.2%, 2 percentage points better than a year ago, and pre-tax loss was $82 million, $22 million better. Higher net pricing and favorable mix more than explained the improvement. As shown in the memo below the chart, full year wholesale volume and revenue declined compared with a year ago, while operating margin and profits improved.
Let's now review Asia-Pacific on slide 18. We are continuing our strategy in Asia-Pacific to invest for growth through both new and expanded plants, new products, and the introduction of Lincoln in China.
As shown on the left, fourth quarter wholesale volume was up 2% compared with a year ago, while net revenue, which excludes our China JVs, declined 9%. Our China wholesale volume, which isn't shown, was up 5% in the quarter.
The higher volume in the region is more than explained by higher industry volume. We estimate fourth quarter SAAR for the region at 40.7 million units. That's up 600,000 units from a year ago. Lower market share was a partial offset.
Our fourth quarter market share at 3.5% was down 0.1 percentage points from a year ago. Our market share in China also deteriorated 0.1 percentage points to 4.3%. This was due to a wholesale industry that was well above trend.
Asia-Pacific's lower revenue reflects lower volume from consolidated operations and unfavorable exchange. Operating margin was 3.6%, down 0.2 percentage points from a year ago, and pre-tax profit was $95 million, down $14 million. As shown in the memo below the chart, all full year metrics improved from the year earlier and were records.
In 2014, our China joint ventures contributed $1.3 billion to pre-tax profit, reflecting our equity share of earnings after tax. Additional detail can be found in the appendix.
The balance of results for the region primarily reflect Australia, where we are implementing our transformation plan; India, where we are investing for future growth, including the launch of two plants later this year; and unfavorable industry and economic factors in ASEAN.
On slide 19, we show the factors that contributed to Asia-Pacific's lower fourth quarter pre-tax profit. The decline is more than explained by higher warranty costs related to a field service action. As shown in the memo, Asia-Pacific pre-tax results improved from third quarter, more than explained by favorable volume and mix.
All right, let's turn now on slide 20 to Ford Credit, a strategic asset and an integral part of our global growth and value creation strategy.
Ford Credit provides world-class dealer and customer financial services supported by a strong balance sheet, providing solid profits and distributions to Ford. Ford Credit's improved pre-tax profit this quarter compared with a year ago is more than explained by higher volume and favorable market valuation adjustments to derivatives included in Other. The higher volume reflects increases in consumer finance receivables and operating leases globally, as well as non-consumer finance receivables outside of North America.
A partial offset is lower margin, driven primarily by a one-time reserve in Europe and the runoff of higher-yielding assets originated in prior years in North America. As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was lower than third quarter, explained primarily by lower margin reflecting the Europe reserve.
Slide 21 provides an explanation of the change in Ford Credit's full year pre-tax profit compared with 2013. The improvement is more than explained by higher volume, driven by increases in consumer and non-consumer-financed receivables globally, as well as operating leases in North America.
Partial offsets include unfavorable lease residual performance in North America resulting from lower relative auction values and lower financing margin. The lower financing margin primarily reflects the Europe reserve previously mentioned and lower portfolio pricing in North America.
Next on slide 22 is our automotive gross cash and operating-related cash flow. Automotive gross cash at the end of the quarter was $21.7 billion, a decrease of $1.1 billion from the end of the third quarter. This includes the one-time unfavorable $500 million cash effect associated with the accounting change for our operations in Venezuela.
Automotive operating-related cash flow was positive $500 million, more than explained by profits. During the quarter, debt repayments and pension contributions totaled $600 million, while dividends paid were about $500 million. Full year Automotive operating-related cash flow was $3.6 billion and gross cash declined $3.1 billion.
Slide 23 shows that Automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $13.8 billion. That was $1.1 billion lower than third quarter, including actions taken on our 2016 convertible notes. We ended the quarter with net cash of $7.9 billion and Automotive liquidity of $32.4 billion.
Slide 24 provides an annual update on our global pension plans. Worldwide pension expense, excluding special items, was $1 billion. That was $600 million lower than 2013, driven primarily by higher discount rates at year-end 2013 compared with 2012.
In 2014, we made $1.5 billion in cash contributions to our worldwide funded pension plans, down $3.5 billion reflecting our improved funded status. In 2015, cash contributions to our funded plans are expected to be about $1.1 billion globally, most of which are mandatory.
Worldwide, our pension plans were underfunded by $9 billion at year-end; that's unchanged from year-end 2013 despite significantly lower discount rates, down 80 basis points in the U.S. and about 100 basis points in non-US markets. These were offset by strong asset returns, contributions, and favorable exchange. These results are clear evidence that our derisking strategy is working.
Of the $9 billion underfunded status, about $6.5 billion, or about 70%, is associated with unfunded plans.
Asset returns in 2014 for our U.S. plans were 16.4% and 15.7% for our non-US plans, reflecting fixed income gains as interest rates fell as well strong growth asset returns. We have continued to increase the mix of fixed income assets with the objective of reducing funded status volatility.
The fixed income mix in our U.S. plans at year-end 2014 was 77% and that is up from 70% at year-end 2013. The U.S. plans were 97% funded at year-end.
Slide 25 summarizes our 2014 results for our planning assumptions and key metrics compared with the plan we shared at the beginning of the year. We delivered solid results last year, meeting or exceeding all financial metrics established at the beginning of the year, with the exception of total company pre-tax profit.
Despite a challenging environment, particularly in South America and Russia, and an unprecedented number of product launches, we achieved a total company pre-tax profit of $6.3 billion, which as Mark said was consistent with our most recent guidance of about $6 billion.
Importantly, we also continued to generate positive Automotive operating-related cash flow. So overall 2014 was a successful step forward in implementing our ONE Ford Plan to deliver profitable growth for all.
So this concludes our review of the financial details of our fourth quarter earnings. Now I would like to turn it back to Mark, who is going to take us through our outlook for the business in 2015, looking at the environment as well as our planning assumptions and key metrics.

          Thanks, Bob. Let's take a look at the 2015 year starting on slide 26 with our view of the business environment going forward.
We project global economic growth to be in the 3% range which is going to be led by U.S. and China. Global industry sales are expected to grow to between 88 million and 92 million unites after estimated sales of about 88 million units in 2014. U.S. economic growth is projected in the 3% range. Consumer sentiment is improving along with lower fuel prices, which will boost consumer spending providing support for that growth.
South America faces continued market volatility and policy uncertainty. A weak recovery is expected in Brazil, while Argentina and Venezuela will remain in recession.
In Europe, growth in the euro area slowed after the first quarter of 2014, but it is projected at just above 1% in 2015. In the U.K., growth is projected to remain in the 2.5% to 3% range. In Russia, the combination of lower oil prices, geopolitical events, and ruble depreciation will lead to a sharp decline in GDP and higher inflation.
In Asia-Pacific, China's economic growth is projected in the 7% to 7.5% range. Consumer income growth will support an increase in vehicle sales, but at a more moderate pace this year. And with some encouraging signs of improvement, growth in India is projected to rise above 6% in 2015, supported by a more favorable policy environment.
So stepping back, despite challenges in some key markets, we do expect the global economy to grow in 2015 and be supportive of our projection for higher global industry volume this year.
On slide 27, we summarize our 2015 outlook for our Automotive sector and Ford Credit. We expect North America to be strongly profitable at a level higher than 2014 with an operating margin of 8% to 9%. This outlook includes higher market share and net pricing, reflecting the impact of launching seven all new or significantly refreshed products, as well as the effect of the record 16 launches in 2014, many of which occurred late in the year.
Keep in mind, the F-150 changeover and downtime at our Kansas City plant will impact the first quarter.
In South America, pre-tax results are expected to be substantially improved from 2014, but still a loss. This outlook reflects the continuation of difficult macroeconomic conditions with industry volume about equal to 2014.
We expect higher market share in 2015 as a result of new product introductions, including the all-new Ka. We also expect higher net pricing, in part due to new products, but also to recover at least in part the unfavorable effects of weaker currencies and high local inflation. Finally, our South American results will not include the operating results of our Venezuela operations, including any impact of currency devaluations.
Moving on to Europe, pre-tax results are expected to improve from 2014 but still be a loss. This outlook reflects higher market share, volume, and net pricing in the Europe 20 markets despite intense competition across the region as well as weak economic growth in the euro area. This is updated from our September Investor Day guidance of a loss of about $250 million and that is largely due to uncertainty around conditions in Russia as well as higher pension expense in 2015 as a result of even lower discount rates.
Middle East and Africa is expected to deliver a loss somewhat larger than 2014 as we invest for future growth. And in Asia-Pacific we expect wholesale volume, market share, and pre-tax profit to be higher than 2014 as we continue to introduce new products and bring online new capacity.
Our Automotive net interest expense is expected to be equal to or higher than 2014. And, finally, Ford Credit continues to implement its growth plan and expects pre-tax profit to be equal to or higher than 2014. This outlook reflects year-end managed receivables in the range of $123 billion to $128 billion and managed leverage to continue in the range of 8 to 9 to 1 and distributions of about $250 million.
So moving on, let's look at the expected calendarization of total company 2015 pre-tax results. Slide 28 shows directionally the calendarization of our profits in 2014 will not be consistent with our typical historical trend.
In North America, the all-new F-150 changeover and downtime at the Kansas City plant will affect first quarter results. We also will incur costs and lost volume in the first half of the year related to our seven 2015 product launches, including the Edge and Explorer, and we expect to see the benefit of these launches in the second half of 2015.
In Asia-Pacific, we are leveraging Ford's global product portfolio to introduce 18 new vehicles in 2015. This will result in lower first-half results as we continue to invest in four new plants that will bring new capacity online for the second half of this year.
So now let's take a look at the Total Company planning assumptions and key metrics for 2015, which is shown on slide 29. For 2015, we now expect U.S. industry volume to range from 17 million to 17.5 million units; Europe 20 markets to range from 14.8 million to 15.3 million units; and China to range from 24.5 million to 26.5 million units.
In terms of our financial metrics, we expect Automotive revenue and operating margin to be higher than 2014; Automotive operating-related cash flow to be higher than 2014. And as noted earlier, this is an improvement from our September Investor Day guidance of positive. This also includes capital spending of about $7.5 billion.
Ford Credit pre-tax profit to be equal to or higher than 2014 and Company pre-tax profit to range from $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion. So, overall, very strong growth and substantially improved financial performance are expected in 2015, driven by our investments in new products and capacity.
Closing all this out on the next slide, our priorities remain consistent and that is to accelerate the pace of progress of our ONE Ford Plan, deliver product excellence with passion, and drive innovation in every part of our business. And all of this underpinned with a continuing day-to-day focus on operational excellence.
We are committed to our long-term objectives that we shared with you and we are making progress towards them as we execute our strategic framework. This framework is built on strong brands serving all markets with a complete family of best-in-class vehicles to lead in providing innovative mobility solutions through our Ford Smart Mobility initiatives and deliver operational excellence that is among the best in the business.
Our success depends on a skilled and motivated team. The Ford team is among the best in the business. We intend to ensure that we have the right talent for a rapidly changing world and that we maintain the trust and the familiarity that allows us to rely on each other's strengths to tackle any business issue.
Looking ahead, the global automotive industry presents substantial growth opportunities, as well as rapid change, and we intend to take advantage of both. 2015 is going to be a breakthrough year for Ford, driven by our unprecedented 24 global product launches in 2014 and another 15 global launches planned this year.
This is our ONE Ford story and we are confident in its continued success. At this point love to open it up for questions. George?

          Good morning, everyone. Just a question on Europe. Was hoping we could dig a little bit more into the details around some of the incremental headwinds. You mentioned the pension expense in 2015.
Then maybe a big picture view on what it takes now as you look at the market to return to profitability. Maybe an update on what you think the reasonable timetable there and what else you can do to take actions to respond to conditions there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, as you step back and you look at Europe, we have had some success in meaningfully improving the business in Europe. When you look at the three elements of the transformation plan -- brand, product, and cost -- on the product side we've introduced over half of the 25 products that we said we were going to introduce. We increased our share as we mentioned earlier.
Importantly, the investments we have made in commercial vehicles are paying off. We have gone from the number seven commercial vehicle market share brand to number three last year.
So we've made progress on product; we've made progress on brand. Our favorability is improving. Our channel mix is improving and actually our channel mix of retail and fleet is healthier than the rest of the industry, about 3 points above. And we made progress on costs as we completed the restructuring actions, and as we know, that will save us ongoing between $450 million and $500 million a year.
As we look at the industry going forward, as Bob mentioned, we are impacted by the lower discount rates, which impact our pension costs. Obviously, the situation in Russia is going to continue to impact us and will be a drag on our earnings for a period of time.
As we look at the industry, we are seeing -- we do think that some of the impacts of lower energy costs will help the consumer, which will be positive. On the same token, we also know that there's still a lot of challenges that Europe faces.
And our approach going forward, we're going to continue to use our process, Itay, which is use that creating value roadmap process, continue to look at the business environment, understand any additional actions that we need to take to improve the business situation. And that's what we're going to do.
In terms of guidance on profitability, we are going to be -- our objective is to be profitable as soon as possible using those elements that I just outlined.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Itay Michaeli,  Citigroup - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That's very helpful, Mark. And then just two quick follow-up housekeeping questions.
Any guidance on the year-over-year P&L impact from the Venezuela accounting change? Maybe what the 2014 losses were and what the benefit could be in 2015. And then maybe I missed this, but if you have a 2015 CapEx outlook that would be great. And that's all I had.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          On the last one, Mark mentioned on the next to last slide I think that our guidance is $7.5 billion. That is just a touch up from the $7.4 billion that we saw in 2014.
On Venezuela, we are not providing -- we don't generally provide specific profitability on either markets or product lines. We did lose money in Venezuela; it's been very volatile. I think that's the thing that has been the most difficult about the market in terms of financial effect.
So going forward, as we explained in the 8-K, Itay, there will be no effect on the Company's results from what happens in Venezuela other than, if we can obtain cash from the authorities in Venezuela and use that cash to either omit a dividend or use that cash to purchase components that we could then ship into Venezuela to support production, then the profit or the cash flow associated with that transaction will be reflected in our results. But otherwise nothing, so there will be no effect.
If we get no further cash or we don't require components or can't obtain components to ship in there will be no effect on our results from Venezuela.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Murphy,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning, guys. Just a first question; if we think about the guidance for North America margins of 8% to 9% for the full year and then the cadence of earnings that you alluded to on slide 28 it would indicate that the margins in the second half of the year, or maybe even in the second quarter in North America, will be 10% or potentially higher.
Should we think about that as a more normal operating environment or more normal level that you might be able to achieve in the future versus what we will see early in the year? I'm just trying to understand that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, what we have said consistently for a number of years is North America should run between 8% to 10%. Of course that is going to vary; depends on the quarter, depends on where we are in product cadence, launch cycles, what is happening in the external environment, what competition might be doing. But it should range in there.
In fact, if you look at prior to 2014 we kind of averaged a bit over 9% from 2010 through 2013. We did better the last two of those years. But then we got into the big launch period and we said we would be in the 8% to 9% range this year. Thought low-end; we came in sort of mid. So Joe and the team did a great job in the fourth quarter, particularly on costs, and so we did better a bit than we had thought.
As we move into next year, 8% to 9% continues to be the guidance. We are affected by the launches in the first quarter; not just F-Series, but some other very high-margin products that Mark mentioned, the Explorer and the Edge. And we actually have still a very active year of launches in North America, I think seven overall. So it will have an impact in the first half, primarily first quarter.
Your thesis is right. We will see a lower margin than on average through the year in the first quarter. It will start to recover and be very attractive in the second, third, and fourth, and give us the type of margin that we are describing for the full year.
And we will see how things work out. We might have the opportunity to operate at the higher end of that range, but I think it's a bit too early to say. I would rather let the year get underway, see how all these launches go -- as you know, F-Series went very, very well -- and then we will update you as the year goes on.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Murphy,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. Then just a second question on Asia Pac. It looks like the results in China are coming through pretty strong. The JV net income or equity income was $1.3 billion almost. Yet it looks like the rest of the business is really under some pretty significant pressure. For the full year you posted almost a $700 million loss.
I know you've alluded to some actions there, but is there anything else that you need to do as far as rationalization or restructuring in that business that would be more concrete and provide for better results going forward? What would the charges look like for that or what would the actions look like for that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          When you step back, John, and you look at the results outside, obviously part of it is due to just the business environment that we are dealing with there and the currencies. But we focus on the things we can control, and to your point, as you know, in Australia we are restructuring the business. We're closing our plant there in 2016.
So we are working our way through that and also at the same time introducing -- we will have 30% more products in the market over the next couple of years to drive the top line as we are working the cost side to hopefully improve the bottom line.
In India, it's about the investments we are making for growth. As you know, we are opening our second major assembly facility there, which is not only going to support the domestic market but is going to be an export hub for us as well. So we are working on that and we are seeing the upfront investments around that, which is driving the situation.
We are starting to see, as you heard in my remarks earlier, a little bit more encouraging results we expect from an economic standpoint, which should help domestically. And in ASEAN working our way through not only the business environments there but looking in each and every country to make sure that we have the appropriate product lineup, that we take advantage of some of the opportunities and strengths that we have in some of our particular products and use that to drive our business higher.
But the team is very focused on that piece of the business so in total Asia-Pacific can contribute equally.

Rod Lache,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [14]

          Good morning, everybody. A couple things. One, your content costs in North America was like an $18 million headwind, which seems pretty modest considering the magnitude of the new product ramp that you are going through. I was hoping you could give us some sense of how we should be thinking about that in 2015.
Looking at the Europe business, perhaps you can give us some brackets around the year-over-year impact you are anticipating from Russia. And then lastly, since you guys gave guidance oil prices obviously have dropped pretty dramatically, 40%, 50%. Europe has adopted pretty aggressive QE. A lot of people view that as likely mitigating rate increases in the US.
I guess high level, when you think about the changes that have occurred since the end of September, how do those influence your views on the outlook for North America into 2015? Because I think you were expecting pretty flat earnings net of the non-recurrence of charges last year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Rod. Bob, why don't you take the first two and I will take the last one?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Do you want to take the last one first?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Sure. In terms of looking at the changes that you mentioned, obviously the drop in the oil prices will be good for consumers and we think that will help the economy. As you saw, Rod, we are expecting some growth in the industry.
So far we haven't -- we take a look back and see if there was any correlation between low fuel prices and growth of the industry, and there's not a lot of correlation there. So we are very comfortable with our call for the industry, which is really driven by replacement demand, because as you know the industry has run under replacement demand for five years. So we think that provides a good foundation.
In terms of the mix and what that means for segmentation, it could be an opportunity, but we really don't know yet the impact of lower oil prices, what that means for the industry here in the US.
If we look at the fourth quarter, what we saw in the fourth quarter was very consistent segmentation changes that we see seasonally over the years. You see full-sized pickups rise because manufacturers are getting more aggressive. You see premium rise as some of the luxury OEMs go for leadership and you see small cars actually go down.
So we think we will see -- the first quarter will be key to gauge if there is changes in the segmentation, because as you know, in the first quarter we usually see small vehicles and small cars actually go up as a percent of the industry. But stepping back at a high level, we think it's positive for the economy, positive for the consumer, and that is the backdrop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Rod, in terms of the first question around content, you didn't see much in the way of material cost in the quarter because the amount of new products that we actually wholesaled in the quarter wasn't that material, if you will. You will start to see that more fully in the first quarter when we report in April. Because what you had is you had really good, strong material cost reductions that the team delivered that largely mitigated the effect of what we did see in terms of product costs.
So in 2015 for North America you're going to see a much, much stronger business. As we said earlier, you are going to have a lot of growth in terms of volume. You are going to have higher share. You are going to have much stronger net pricing. And that is on the back of the products that we launched last year, which will have full year effects this year, along with the ones that we will newly launch largely in the first quarter of this year.
But with that, what you will see is you will see a substantial increase in product costs and you will also see higher structural costs. Particularly if you go back to the F-150 program, given the scope of that program, the degree to which we had to change and refacilitize the facilities, that piece will obviously be with us for most of the year given the timing of the launch of Kansas City.
So very, very strong improvement in the top line, but you will see cost increases flowing through both at the product level and structural level.
In terms of Europe, it is interesting. When you look at Europe and you go back to the transformation plan that Stephen Odell and his team announced back in, I think it was October of 2012, in that Russia was an important element because we had made a decision to go with a local partner, which has been good. At the time we were looking at an industry that could grow to 4 million units, I think it was, by the end of the decade. It was at sometime between then and the end of the decade going to become the largest industry in Europe.
And of course that has all changed; it is just a difficult situation. We're looking now at industry volume this year that is probably sub-2 million units. You've got very high interest rates. You've got the collapse of the ruble. You've also got, in our case for example, in all the euro-based manufacturers very aggressive pricing to respond to the change of the ruble versus the euro.
And then we've got competitors, particularly the Japanese and then the Koreans as well, who have not had to price as much because their currencies had already weakened relative to the euro and the dollar. So there is a change in the competitive environment within Russia as well, which we are trying to respond to.
So we do expect to see a big headwind from Russia in 2015 and that is the major change in the guidance that we are providing versus what we said in September. And when you think about it the question you're going to ask me is, well, you wrote off your equity in the second quarter of your 50/50 JV, so you had said at the time that that won't have any financial effect on you if they were to continue to incur losses, which is true.
But we still provide components and make money on those components. We still provide after-service parts, make money on those. We still engineer the products that they will ultimately build and sell, so we are incurring that expense. And for that we receive royalties, which of course are going to be lower. All of that is lower because the volumes are lower.
But in addition, frankly, because of the very difficult situation the business is facing there, the partners are having to provide additional support for the business. And of course we are working very closely together to respond to what is a dramatically different environment than what we thought even six months ago.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Just to Bob's point, we are acting very proactively in Russia. We've cut production. We reduced overhead, but also we are working the top line. As you know, we are introducing six new products between mid-year last year and the end of 2015, so I guess I would term it there's never a bad time to introduce good product in any market and that's our approach.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rod Lache,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Can you bracket the impact that you are expecting? It just seems like you've changed a lot over there, but what is the magnitude?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Well, the only thing I would guide you to in the appendix, you can see the year-over-year effect of Russia on Europe and it was $350 million. All I will say is that the environment in 2015 is more difficult.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adam Jonas,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, everybody. Can you remind us how much of the pickup truck market in North America last year, or whatever period that you have that is recent and relevant, is tied to oil and gas end-markets and maybe the great Lone Star State specifically?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Adam, this is Mark. We don't have a specific number, but obviously it's a piece of it. Obviously the biggest piece of pickup truck is the housing market, but what we have seen is there could be some --.
As we step back and we look at the energy prices and what that may mean, for example, for wellhead drilling and all that kind of -- those type of things, it could have a slight negative impact in, let's say, the Southwest. But keep in mind we could see positive impact in the rest of the country from lower fuel prices with more money in consumers' pockets. Plus the other thing that is encouraging, you look at the latest housing numbers in terms of starts and permits, etc., we could see an offset on that. So that's basically the way I would characterize it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adam Jonas,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Mark. Just as a follow-up, what would your team rank as a more worrisome issue to you: the strong U.S. dollar or these CAFE standards that are kind of completely out of touch with reality beyond 2017? And a follow-on to that, maybe could Ford weigh in on where -- on the issue of raising the gasoline tax? Guys have any dog in that hunt? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, well, let me take the last one first. The gasoline tax, our position is we will leave that to the policymakers to figure out whether they have support for that. What we are in support of is the things that we can control and what we can control is continue to have the team focused on delivering affordable and fuel-efficient vehicles to the market that people want and value, so that's our approach.
In terms of the two things you mentioned, the impact of the strong dollar. As Bob mentioned, we are not seeing a big bottom-line effect on our financials in 2015 because it's a multifaceted thing. On the positive side, a strong U.S. dollar indicates strength in our economy and obviously that's good given our position in the market here and it's our largest and most profitable.
Alternatively, a strong dollar has an effect, as Bob mentioned, on our competitive position, especially against competitors who import here into the US. They could take it through pricing, reduced pricing, or increased content.
So as we think about that for exchange, for exchange movements that are driven by the markets and not by governments, we will deal with the hand that we are given and use our creating value roadmap process to improve the situation.
On the regulatory, it is a big issue. As you know, to meet those requirements it is going to be very important for consumers to adopt the new technologies, the electrified vehicles, etc., and that is an important part of meeting the country's goals. What we're seeing right now is they are not adopting them to the levels anywhere near that we expected, so that is why we are very looking forward to the mid-term review with the government.
And, as you know, to agree to the one national standard we wanted to make sure we had a mid-term review to look at the feasibility of the goals, cost to the consumer, impact on jobs, etc. So that's probably the one that -- is the one that we focus a lot on because it requires a market response from that and adoption, and we're not seeing it at this point.

          Colin Langan, UBS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Langan,  UBS - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          My first question is can you just give a broad update of the F-150 launch and the Dearborn plant ramping? Is it fully ramped this point? Is Kansas City on schedule? And do you have any color of the new F-150 is pricing -- any color around pricing there in particular?
The second question is on foreign exchange. How are you being impacted by FX? Because you are expected to lose money in Europe and South America, so does some of the volatility there actually shrink the translation of losses? Is that a net positive to you or is the intra-regional FX impact more than offsetting that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. Thanks, Colin. I will take the first one. I'm surprised it took that long to get an F-150 question, but I'm glad we did.
We are exactly on plan where we expected to be with the F-150 launch. We have added the third crew at our Dearborn Truck Plant. We're almost completely through the acceleration curve, a little bit more time on that, but that's going smoothly. In Kansas City, we have installed the equipment into the body shop and the team is going through the debugging right now, so that is absolutely on plan.
As you look at the market response, as we noted in December, we are seeing very strong demand for the F-150. It is our fastest-turning vehicle on the lot and actually, as we look at this month -- we have a few more days to close -- if we track as we expected, we could have our best January since 2004. And we will see a material increase in terms of the percent of our -- the 2015 F-150s as a percent of our total sales.
The mix has been rich, which is good, and just anecdotally, we were in the NADA convention this weekend talking with dealers and I had a number of dealers tell me that they haven't even driven the truck home yet because literally as soon as they are showing up on the vehicle transports they are going out. So very, very encouraging initial response to the F-150 and we are bang on where we expected to be in terms of our launch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Colin, in terms of your question on exchanges, I'm looking at 2015. It doesn't -- broadly across the Company there are some ups and downs, but it doesn't seem to have much of a material impact.
I think you are technically right; where we have losses like in South America and Europe, just looking at the translation effect, obviously the loss in local currency will translate into fewer dollars. But there are other flows; you have got pounds, you've got euros, you've got a number of different currencies at play there.
But broadly, for the whole company it's not having much of an effect there. I won't talk again about the competitive factor. I think that's the bigger concern that we have in terms of the impact on the business is the competitive factor that Mark touched on, but he handled that.
So the only other thing I would say is I think when we are having conversations around exchange, and particularly a strong dollar, we probably also should at least comment on commodities because there is a correlation between the dollar and commodities and -- well, many currencies and commodities. What we are seeing, in fact, as the dollar has strengthened we are starting to see good news on the horizon from commodities and it is pretty much across most commodities. We think that will actually be a help for the business in 2015.

Brian Johnson,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning. Just given the volatility of fuel prices, I want to ask a question we haven't really talked about for a while, which is around the flexibility in your factories to go back and forth between CUVs and sedans because it really seems the consumer is rotating away from sedans towards CUVs. A couple -- three questions.
One, can you recap just what factories you have right now that currently can go back and forth between the two? Two, do you see more scope for doing that perhaps as you roll over some platforms in the next few years so you have that flexibility? And three, do you currently have with work rules, layoffs, reassignment provisions the kind of flexibility in your union contracts you would need to kind of get to the nirvana of being able to flex to where the customer demand is?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Brian. Let me take the last one first. When you look at the flexibility, if you recall, back in the 2011 contract very importantly we came to agreements with our UAW colleagues around improved flexibility. And that has worked wonderfully for us over the last number of years in terms of adding Saturday hours or increased shifts, etc.
In terms of the flexibility between cars and CUVs, I don't know the number off the top of my head in terms of the number of plants, but I would say it is fairly limited in terms of a plant that produces a car and a CUV and utility. But we do have opportunities as we see the market move, again using that flexibility, the work rule flexibility that we have with the unions, to either add additional weekend days or in some cases increase line rates.
And to your second point about going forward, obviously that's something that we continue to look at as we plan our product cycles and our manufacturing -- optimizing our manufacturing footprint to take into account shifts. And then can we get the flexibility that we want in our manufacturing plants? We do have that, for example, in a plant in Wayne, Michigan, where we produce a number of different vehicles and engines, but we will continue to look at that going forward.

Ryan Brinkman,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning, thanks for taking my call. I know you discussed the impact of fuel prices on segment mix earlier and that is important, but looking at it from a different perspective, can you help us in terms of sizing up maybe your annual logistics and freight expense? How to think about how that could be impacted by, say, a 50% drop in fuel prices, whether we should be taking that into account in our models?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, that is sort of a corollary to the commodities. The oil price decline is going to give us the opportunities to see reductions in logistics expenses and we are already seeing that as an opportunity for this year, so you are spot on.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ryan Brinkman,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, great. Then I guess as a follow-up to that; I know you have pass-through agreements with suppliers to compensate them when commodity prices rise and to recoup those savings when they fall. Do you have a way to capture the change in the suppliers' logistics expenses or are they sort of permitted to keep that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          That would probably be subject to negotiation with them, but we do issue -- as you said and we've talked to you about it before, we do have indexing across parts of our supply base related to commodities. So as they go up, there's adjustments. As they go down, there's adjustments.
I think the logistics impact, just as it is for us is a more indirect impact. But certainly we are aware of that and would hope to capture that as that opportunity occurs at the level of the supplier.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Also, just add to that, we manage a lot of the inbound logistics into our plants, so we will work that aspect as well in terms of what we can control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ryan Brinkman,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay, that's helpful. Then just last question for me on China. Lots of talk of China slowdown recently, but actually it hasn't slowed. We continue to see all-time record highs there, 25-plus-million SAAR in December, etc.
How are you thinking about China industry in 2015? What is the latest you are seeing on the ground? Then, if sales did slow, does that necessarily impact your plan since you are also gaining a lot of market share?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great, Ryan. As we look at China we still see growth. As you saw from our projections, we expect it to be between 24.5 million and 26.5 million units. Again, a lot of that growth is coming from the Tier 3 through 6 cities as consumers -- their income rises and they are able to buy a vehicle.
As we look at the industry overall, we had record market share there last year of 4.5% and, as I mentioned, record number of wholesales. We expect our business to grow again this year and the reason for that is because we are bringing on another plant.
We just launched our Escort at the end of last year. We have a number of products coming this year which are products that actually increase our segment breadth. So it's not just about introducing a new product in a segment we are already in, it's introducing products into segments we have not been in. So we think that that provides a good basis for us.
We're coming off a position of strength. The brand is held in high regard. The Focus was the best-selling nameplate again for the second or third year in a row, and our buyers tend to be younger and have higher income than the industry average. Working with our partners we have really built out our distribution network, particularly in those Tier 3 through 6 cities.
So we expect growth; not as much in the industry as we saw last year for the reasons I cited earlier, but we are very encouraged by the positive response we might get from our new products to help grow our business.

Emmanuel Rosner,  CLSA Limited - Analyst    [43]

          Good morning, everybody. Wanted to drill down a little bit more on the earnings impact from some of the large investments you made last year.
In North America specifically you were mentioning before you expect stronger volume, share and pricing, but also a substantial increase in product cost and structural cost. So wanted to just ask on both these things; first of all, on the product costs versus pricing, do you expect it to be net positive this year?
Then on the structural cost, I don't know if you will provide guidance specifically on that, but by how much do you expect D&A to increase this year? Obviously you have been running at $4 billion plus when you were spending $7.5 billion on CapEx. So do you expect a substantial increase in D&A this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes, let me -- do you want me to take that? So if I look at the Company and I look at our structural costs, they will be up more than they were in 2014 versus 2013. The biggest factors of that will actually be engineering and manufacturing.
And some of that is not just because of what we have already done, but obviously we are still investing for even more growth in the years ahead, particularly if you go back to Investor Day and think about the type of growth that we were projecting out through 2020. So those are the two biggest factors.
But we will see an increase in D&A. I'm not going to provide a specific number. It's, not by any means, the largest of the elements that we will see next year, but it will be a good increase in terms of the size. And again, that is related to investments that we will have already made or perhaps some made during the year.
In terms of pricing, we will see strong positive pricing both for product-related actions and -- as we always do -- and that was evident in the fourth quarter, too, in terms of the pricing we achieved around the world, where we can opportunistically take pricing unrelated to product we will do that. And I would expect that to be the case again in 2015.
But, again, we have to be very sensitive to the competitive position and that plays back in some of the earlier comments around what the Japanese competitors in particular may do, particularly in the super segment vehicles. But we will have very strong pricing. Again, obviously since we expect the results for the Company and for North America to be better, we do expect for the combination of the volume, the revenue that we will see more of that in terms of the positive effect than we will through the combination of the cost increases that we see.

Patrick Archambault,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, most of my questions have been answered. Actually, just one for me. The increased free cash flow guidance from positive to higher, what are the main drivers behind that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          When we gave the guidance of positive we were just saying that it wasn't going to be negative. It's still going to be positive cash flow and that is -- we were waiting because obviously, as you know, cash flow is a change of a change to some extent, so we wanted to see how we did in 2014. Now we have a good baseline and we can look and understand what we are looking at for 2015.
Clearly, we're going to see it driven by the top line, so the profitability is going to be a lot stronger. We see about no change in terms of the CapEx. We've already talked about that, the $7.5 billion versus the $7.4 billion.
And then I think the changes that we will see in working capital and timing differences are not that material in terms of preventing us from seeing the fuller flow-through of what's happening on the improved profitability. I think that the profits are probably the single-biggest driver that will flow through to the operating profitability.

Joseph Spak,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, good morning. Wanted to ask another F-150 question, but this one about maybe the initial fleet reception. You've talked about maintaining, if not improving, the cost of ownership. Obviously we saw the mpgs on the new versus the old and now fuel is a little bit lower, so maybe less of a benefit there.
And I'm sure you've seen the Edmunds report which showed that the labor to replace aluminum could be maybe 4x steel and maybe 2x the time. So was wondering: are there are offsets to that cost of ownership that we are not considering? I know the residual is a little bit higher, but wanted to see how that pitch to fleet is going.
And then related I guess; how are you supporting the repair shops, both for Ford dealers and the independents, with getting up to speed on aluminum?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great. Thanks, Joseph, for that question.
When you look at the F-150 in terms of the response from the fleets, obviously we are just starting to ship. And as you mentioned, total cost of ownership is very important to them and their interest in the vehicle is very high. We are just starting to ship vehicles to them in that regard and we think it is going to go well.
All you have to do is -- I know it's a different vehicle, but if you look at our Transit, for example, which we launched last year, if you look at even in the month of December, we had our highest share in the van and bus segment since 2006 with a new product. So as you know what fleets do is they take a few units first, they get some experience with them, and once they have good experience with them they really start ramping up the orders. And we expect to see that with F-150.
In terms of cost of ownership, and this gets back to what the purchasing managers are looking at, as we've said the total cost of ownership for the new F-150 is going to be very competitive. We saw the Edmunds report and, unfortunately, the experience with the dealer was incorrect. The amount of time to repair based on the standards that we have developed and also shared with the dealers, it would have been about half the time so it wasn't quite correct.
At the same time, as you know, we designed the F-150 so that when there are issues, body issues, etc., that the way we designed it from a modular standpoint is actually very efficient to actually repair the vehicle.
So overall, in terms of what we've done, we've trained over 750 dealers to be certified. Unfortunately, this dealer that Edmunds went to was not one of them; they have not gone through that yet. But we have certified over 750 and we have worked with over 1,000 independent body shops to get them ready for the F-150. But overall with the overall competitive -- very competitive cost of ownership.

          Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be accepting questions from the media. (Operator Instructions) Alisa Priddle, Detroit Free Press.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alisa Priddle,  Detroit Free Press - Media    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning, gentlemen. Couple things first; I didn't catch what the percentage of the mix was of the new F-150s when you were talking about sales in January. And secondly, Mark, was hoping you would just talk a little bit about your continued efforts to make quality a priority given that there was an additional $1.3 billion in warranty costs in 2014.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Very good, Alisa. As I mentioned in December, 5% of our total F-Series was the new F-150. In January, we still have the month yet to close, but you will see a number higher than that as we close out January, as we stock up the units and as we get them to customers. So you will see a higher number -- or a higher percentage.
In terms of quality, as you know, we have had a lot of focus on quality. We have had great progress around the world. We've seen some of our own internal surveys of initial quality be very positive, particularly around the vehicles that we've launched because traditionally we have had some issues around launch. And I think the team is doing a very good job on making sure that the quality that we send out on our new products is what customers expect.
And we are seeing that progress verified by third-party results, whether it is J.D. Power or even Consumer Reports. So we're going to continue to say very focused on that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alisa Priddle,  Detroit Free Press - Media    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Okay. Were there any lessons learned from what you saw in 2014, or are recalls just too unpredictable?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          You know, it's difficult to predict recalls, and some of those were obviously on some older models. We took a lot of lessons from 2012 and 2013, and the team has used that to help our launches actually in 2014. So hopefully we will see that reflected in our quality results and potentially recalls going forward, but we will wait and see.

Mike Ramsey,  Wall Street Journal - Media    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning, everybody. I know that you guys have new guidance to 2020, but I'm curious; I know that the midterm guidance for mid-decade at one point was 8 million sales globally and we are a couple million off of that. Did things not go as quickly in terms of ramping up your global sales as expected? And if so, where was it not as fast as you anticipated?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Right. Thanks, Mike. When we actually announced the mid-decade guidance back in 2011, we said it was -- here are our assumptions and at that point in time Europe hadn't tanked and South America hadn't imploded. So when you take all that into account, a lot of -- if you look at what we projected in terms of the number of wholesales, we had an assumption around industry around the world in the regions and that has changed dramatically given some of the realities of the marketplace.
That being said, as you look back on a number of things on the mid-decade guidance, we have actually achieved and we've factored those into our 2020 guidance going forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike Ramsey,  Wall Street Journal - Media    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          So do you feel pretty good though that -- I know South America is a head scratcher a little bit, but do you think that some of these markets where you've made big investments are going to pick back up again? That we are going to -- it was a stumble and you will see the previously anticipated growth?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Yes. We spend a lot of time on making sure that the capital that we allocate that we are going to earn an appropriate return.
If you look at South America, we know that the business environment in the region remains volatile, which is going to add uncertainty to the near-term outlook. But in the longer term, it is an attractive and important place to do business. We want to continue to serve our customers there.
As you know, the previous decade we made a very good return on our investments in South America and we expect that going forward in the medium to long-term.

          Good morning, thanks for taking the call. Can you just talk briefly about China market share and where you expect that to go this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Dee-Ann. As we mentioned, we have a number of new products launching in new segments. We have two new plants coming online in China, one an assembly plant and one an engine plant, so we expect in China that to positively impact our sales.
We are not giving out a market share objective. Our objective usually -- as usual around the world is we are going to sell as many people want. We have seen our share grow pretty dramatically there over the last two or three years. As we mentioned, we had a record last year at 4.5% in China, and we expect that to grow based on some of the new segments and what we feel are compelling products for Chinese consumers.

Bernie Woodall,  Thomson Reuters - Media    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          This is Bernie Woodall imitating Joe White. Could you do me a favor -- and I know you've talked a little bit about Europe already, but just looking at yesterday, Sergio Marcchione on the Fiat Chrysler call said things are going to be improved in Europe over a low base and Fiat made profit in Europe in the fourth quarter. General Motors is looking to make a turn of profit next year.
The casual observer might look at this and say, oh, what is Ford's problem in Europe? Can you address that vis-a-vis your competition there? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Bernie, it's Bob and I'm sure Mark will add comments. We -- again I think, if you pull apart the business, we have made great, great progress on the European transformation plan if I put Russia to the side. You can see that in the results on a year-over-year basis when you go through the data.
We are seeing improvement in the top line. We gained in share. We actually held price on a year-over-year basis in a very, very competitive environment and we saw a reduction in our cost. So everything is moving in the right directions, but as I said earlier, we have made a bet on Russia.
We think that is going to be an important market in the future. It is going to grow. It is a commodity-based economy, so it is being hurt right now for what's going on in terms of oil prices, as well as of course the geopolitical issues. But we still have confidence that over time that could be an attractive market and we would like to participate in that.
I don't know to what extent some of the competitors do or don't participate in the Russian market and what effect it would have on their results, but certainly that is probably the area that has had the most impact versus what we had originally expected when we set out the transformation plan. As Mark said earlier, we have a lot of work underway to respond to a very changed environment and to make sure that as that market recovers that we can participate fully in that opportunity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - President & CEO    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I would just add we are going to continue to work our process. And, Bernie, as you know, when you do comparisons it is important that you just look at the profiles of the various companies.
In our case, we are in Russia with our partners. I don't know if that's the case for some of our other competitors. Have to look at accounting treatments and things that were -- that may have been gone away because of bankruptcy of others that impact results. So it's really making sure you do the appropriate kind of benchmarking between the two operations.
But we are going to stay focused. It is an important market for us. We've made a lot of progress. We have more headwinds, a lot of it driven by Russia, and we will deal with them positively.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bernie Woodall,  Thomson Reuters - Media    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you. If I could steal one more, you mentioned earlier, Bob, that by 2020 a few years ago you were looking at 4 million in sales in Russia. Is there any venture of what is your guidepost there for -- by the end of the decade in Russia? Are you making any guess?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP & CFO    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I think it's probably too uncertain to make a call at this point. Clearly, if you look at outside third-party forecasts, those numbers have come way down.
But one thing you got to be careful of with any of these more volatile economies is that when you at a high you've got to be careful you don't project that out. And when you're at a low you don't want to just say that that's where we are going to be for the next five years either, because what goes up comes down and vice versa.
But I think it clearly probably is a less positive forecast at this point. But I think once they come out of it and our expectations are that Russia will be one of the larger industries in Europe over the mid to long-term.
