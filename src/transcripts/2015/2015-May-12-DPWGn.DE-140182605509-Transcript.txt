Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head, IR    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.  And hello and welcome to everyone out there.  It's less than nine weeks after we talked to you about the closing of the 2014 and here we are with our Q1 2015 reporting.
And as you've seen on the invitation I've got here with me, Group CEO and Interim Divisional CEO of the forwarding division, Frank Appel, and our Group CFO, Larry Rosen, who will take you, as usual, through the presentation that I take you have also in front of you.  And after that there should be time also for Q&A.
And without further ado I'd like to hand over to you, Frank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, welcome as well from my side.  Good afternoon and good morning.  So I'm happy to start with the highlights on Page 3 of Q1.
So we have actually more or less experienced what we have expected with the continuation of a very strong parcel growth in the PeP division and a continuation of the letter decline, as I will explain as well, some good development in the parcel areas outside Germany too.
And the EBIT due to the same reason as we have communicated in the last quarters, EBIT was flat due to higher cost, in particular, with the staff cost.
Express's growth momentum is -- has not changed at all; it's fully intact.  We are seeing a nice growth on the top line and even stronger growth on the EBIT with also very good cash flow.
Forwarding, yes, there is a challenge.  We are not satisfied where we are.  As you know, we had a change in the management.  I took over that as the acting CEO for the division.  And I brought a very well -- in the industry well-known colleague back to that game.   I come to that later on.
And now we are jointly focusing in particular in how we get the operational performance to a better level.  And we also will spend in the weeks a review of how we continue with the transformation course.
Supply Chain is now really in the execution phase and we will see that continuing through the year.  We have billed first provisions to really implement the measures we have defined.  I am satisfied with the progress I see here, the development is heading in the right direction and I have no doubt that this will continue too.
And overall cash flow was good.  It is impacted by the normal pension payment we have for the civil servants in the first quarter.  And therefore we are confident that we will make our numbers this year and we can keep our guidance as well for next year.  We will come to that later on again.
On Page 4 you see the details of the divisions.  Revenue overall is pretty strong, but we had two effects.  One is that we had currency, of course, which is bringing that up due to the weaker euro.
But on the other side in Express and Forwarding we had some negative impact as well from reduced fuel surcharge due to a drop in fuel and that has impact on the top line.
Overall we had a good organic growth of more than 2% for the Group.  And you see here as well a flat EBIT again in the first quarter good and an excellent result in Express continuation of what we have seen the last quarters.
Forwarding, as mentioned, has been challenged.  In supply chain a dip in the EBIT number comes actually only the -- from our restructuring expenses.  And therefore the overall had a flattish year, with minus -- flattish quarter, sorry, with a minus 1%.
We now look into the detail of the divisions.  On Page 5 you see PeP.  If we talk about revenue growth in the letter part, mail communication is pretty stable.  That's the result of an expected decline of less than 2%. We obviously guided that overall we decline with 2% to 3%, but that was compensated somehow by the postage increase.
We also increased in dialogue marketing the prices mid of last year.  And therefore we of course see a continuation of that trend in the first quarter here, despite that the volume chipped it.  But it was almost compensated by the revenue increase of -- revenue per piece.
Parcel growth very strong, revenues even further up than volumes, which is good. That shows that, as we have said earlier already, they have definitely seen the bottom of the price level, which is reflected in these numbers, which is good.
And internationally in Europe, but also in the rest of the world, under e-commerce we have seen good growth, although it was helped particularly in the e-commerce area quite significantly as well by currency, so overall good development of volumes, particularly in the parcel area.
We still -- and that is shown on Page 6, the challenge.  We are now talking to the union for a while.  We introduced in January a new subsidiaries -- or a set of subsidiaries, actually, where we offer the employees permanent contracts to a lower salary than in the mother company.
These are actually contracts the employers jointly have signed with our union, but they are not specific for us.  And that gives us the opportunity to pay our people in this delivery less than we have paid in [DAG].
What is important is all of these 6,000 people are not people who had a permanent job with DAG.  They are either temporary jobs and therefore they accepted an unlimited contract with these new GmbHs, or we hired them.
One-third is hired from the external market, which shows that we offer an attractive package despite that it's significantly lower than what we have currently as an average in our mother company.
That brings us closer to some of our competitors and that's the argument we are using.  And that's the reason why we got already 6,000 people employed.  We are still paying significantly above the minimum wage.  We pay probably equal or even better than UPS.
Of course, we have not the detail in the last minute, but what we can say due to our size and scale and our responsibility for our employees we continued to have salaries which are at the upper end of the range for our competition.
So that will continue to be a debate.  As you have seen, we had one strike already and we will see more this week, because we have not settled that.  And it will be and will remain a tough, tough discussion.
We believe that this is a good way to balance both our [DSV] interest of the employees on one hand and on the other side the interest of the Company to grow the parcel business in particular successful.
We continue to invest into the parcel business, as shown on Page 7.  We have rebranded [our] meinpaket.de into allyouneed.com.  We launched that in Poland already, so therefore we have more activity here now in Poland already and we will definitely looking into other markets.
In Germany we have extended our activities.  We have now a delivery box not only for a single household, but also for a building with several flats, which will help us as well to get more convenience and comfort for customers or consumers who are living not with their family in a single house.
So these are all things to increase the reach, because we believe customer centricity is important, so the easier they get access, if it's deliver or return options, the better is it business.
Internationally, on Page 8, in Pep we have now started and here you see our description.  We are a good player with nice development of our business in the last 18 months or so.
Our first e-fulfillment center is up and running.  It's operated by the supply chain colleagues in Columbus.  And of course we are being the largest contributor to this company in the US.  We are well equipped to do that.
And we will now watch how that works.  And that's only the first step in a series of activities we will launch.  But of course we will only talk about those when they are live and up.  But this is a first sign already so that we really can improve our capabilities and extend our portfolio in the US.
The same is true for Asia.  As you know, we have with blue dart the strongest company in India, in the Indian market anyway.  And also here our new e-fulfillment facility close to Delhi is in the -- will go live very soon.  And again here working together the two divisions.  So that shows the beauty and the strength of our portfolio.
We don't have to reinvent that.  We have experts for these activities in the respective markets and we will leverage them as well for other markets, be it in fulfillment or using portals for doing delivery or whatsoever.
So I think this -- and you might say this is still small.  It is, but we have a very clear master plan what we can do in addition.  In Europe, for instance, as you might remember we launched in February -- and communicated when we had our annual numbers in Slovakia we launched our first other domestic.  And we will continue to do so and will of course report back when new things are coming on stream.
Express, our nice story here continues.  We have seen significant volume growth. The revenue growth per day is smaller than the volume growth, but there is significant impact also from fuel surcharge.  So you should not worry about that ratio too much, because that's a reflection of that the fuel came down so much and that had impact on the revenue per day.
The revenue -- the shipment growth is intact completely, you see that here as well.  Very nice growth in Middle East/Africa, but also in Europe, Asia not so strong as Europe, but we have that.
In Americas there is some impact from one big customer, which is DOJ, who have obviously [down-traded] due to this changing situation in the Middle East.  But we have really seen here good development overall and we are pretty happy about that.
And the same is visible at least for a certain extent for global forwarding.  We have growth there.  But as we see -- you will see later, the numbers -- so I said already the numbers not reflecting any growth.  So we have a fundamental problem in converting more volume into more gross profit and more bottom line and that's exactly the priority we are facing.
So we have a not satisfactory EBIT performance.  And that's related to the NFE to a certain extent, because we change as well the structure in preparation to further rollouts.
So what we now have done, we have stopped the rollout for the time being to assess where we are, learning more from the pilots.  And we now have to really look into what the changes in structure has made to our P&L.  Renato and I, together with some others who are helping us on that, are working at the moment.
So the best summary of that is on Page 12, where you see that I have taken that over as the divisional head, and representing on the management board, Renato, who has been in this industry for more than 50 years, is now the head for the global Forwarding.
We keep Amadou Diallo as the CEO of DHL Freight.  And we brought somebody for the transformation into that role who was my head of corporate development before and he is now the executive vice president for programs, where we really will reassess the transformation.
The priorities are very well I think summarized here.  We believe that transformation is necessary and important and will help us to improve our performance mid term significantly.  So we have not changed that mind.
And also our very experienced Renato Chiavi says, yes, we need to do something, but probably we need a different approach.  And that's the second bullet point, how we approach that.  And I think we should learn now as much as we can from the pilot countries and should adapt then the organization as well accordingly.
But the first priority for the time being is that we really improve the underlying business performance.  We will take more time for assessing what we want to do with the transformation, as I said.
We believe that the transformation is right.  It should help us to improve the long term -- or mid-term performance significantly.  But what we have in the last 15 months as well the approach we have taken so far [is] not the right one should really get it through and therefore we'll have to revisit [this].
Coming then to the supply chain, good development on new signings, also good development underneath, which is not visible here, of how well these are implemented.  We had good progress from the wins we had in the last quarters, so we are quite encouraged as well.  Our focus on automotive, consumer, life science is also helping us here as well.
So we are pretty happy.  I am pretty happy with the development.  John Gilbert is now in his job for a year.  And all the indications and indicators I see are heading in the right direction.
And therefore I'm pretty optimistic that we will see significant improvement in the coming years, as John has already laid out when he had his capital markets day -- or his tutorial, I think --
So to summarize, on Page 14, we have a busy agenda for this year and that happens once in a while.  It's like a little bit I had a very busy agenda in 2008 and 2009 but on a significantly-lower level, so that's significantly different from the touch and feel.  We have strong management teams in all places and therefore I believe we can deal with these challenges we have.
In forwarding I explained already we have a challenge, but we are now addressing that.  In supply chain I feel very encouraged from the first quarters I have seen under John's leadership and also on the indicators, which we can't communicate.  But as I said most, if not all, indicators are heading in the right direction.
We have a challenge with our negotiation with the union here in Germany, but we believe that we really have found the right approach to deal with that because we have a compelling package for the people and do the right thing for the Company at the same time.
And of course, based on the outstanding performance of Ken Allen's Express division, we will continue to invest into that to extend our distance to our competitors even further.
So that's somehow what we do.  It is a transition year from [30] 2015 to 2020.  I believe that we will build the right momentum this year for our long-term success and that's the reason why we believe that we can achieve the goals we have set already a while ago for 2020.
But this year will not be an easy one, so when we talk next time it will not be all changed already.  We will see still challenges in this year.  But as I explained a minute ago that is well understood and known.
And I think we have good teams on all these subjects to really handle those.  And therefore I'm very confident that this will be a year in hindsight of transformation and preparation for long-term profitable growth.
And with no further [ado] I hand over now to Larry to give you a little bit more flavor on the financials.  Thank you for listening.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So thank you, Frank.  And I'm pleased to continue the presentation now and look at our financial performance for Q1.  And I'll also include a review of performance for each division and finish up with a review of our guidance.
So over onto Page 16 for those that are following along the presentation, we start with a look at our Q1 P&L.  And here revenue increased by 8.8% to around EUR14.8b, reflecting a revenue gain in all four of the divisions.
After adjustment for currency effects the organic growth was around 2.1% and continued to reflect the strong growth in revenues and volumes in the international express business as well as in the German parcel business.
It's also worth mentioning that the decline in energy prices also affects revenue performance.  And if we were to make that adjustment organic growth would have been around 3.5%.
Group EBIT was close to stable with EUR720m.  And our PeP division was also stable despite good growth in our e-commerce and parcel business as the benefits of that were offset by higher factor costs and also lower letter volumes.
As for DHL, we had mixed results.  Express continued its strong performance across all metrics and all regions with EBIT growth of around 20%, while in supply chain and forwarding freight we saw a decline in EBIT compared to last year due to the impact respectively of their announced restructuring and transformation initiatives.
Improvement in our financial result was driven by benefits from the lower interest rate environment, on the interest expense for bonds and on provisions. And the tax rate of 17.5% was pretty close to our full-year guidance of 18%.
Consolidated net profit decreased by around 1%, to EUR495m, pretty much in line then with our EBIT performance.
Now over to Page 17, looking at our cash flow performance, as usual in Q1 in each year we saw significant cash outflows since especially we pay all civil servant pension-related obligations in the first week of the year.  And this year it was around EUR530m.
The year-on-year decrease in free cash flow, to EUR377m negative, was mainly the result of higher cash-out for capital expenditures.  And you see that was pretty much offset -- or more than offset the benefit that we had on the net interest line from a one-off effect of EUR76m related to the monetization of interest rate swaps that we executed in Q1.
And now over to Page 18.  As seasonally usual, our net debt increase in Q1 was mainly due to the once-per-year payment of the civil servant pensions and also the working capital balance that we typically see in Q1.
Further, we had higher net CapEx due to the investments in our networks and infrastructure, whereas, the increase was nearly offset by the positive net interest effects just mentioned.  We expect net debt to further increase in Q2, as we pay the dividend on May 28.
Now onto Page 19, a couple of words about the dividend -- or, sorry, about the pension obligations.  Under current IFRS standards our pension liability or DBO, defined benefit obligation, increases when interest rates or, more specifically, the discount rate declines.
And the discount rate decreased in Q1 to a historically-low level.  And you see those levels on the bottom right below the bar chart in the picture on Page 19.
And that resulted in an increase in the gross pension liability of around EUR2.4b.  Thanks to the strong performance in our pension assets, though, the net pension provision went up by only around EUR1.5b to EUR8.6b net pension provision.
On the P&L we expect a slight increase in personnel costs in the low double-digit million range compared to last year, as well as a slight decrease in financial expenses and, of course, no change in cash flow generation.
Now let's take a look at the individual divisions and their summary financial KPIs.  So for PeP, on Page 20, revenues climb by 3.6% to EUR4.1b, reflecting continued strong growth in the parcel and e-commerce market, and also minor positive foreign currency effects.
EBIT increased by 0.8% to EUR399m.  And this reflects the higher volumes and revenues in e-commerce and parcel, which were partially offset, however, by higher staff and purchased goods and services costs.  We also have costs associated with the expansion of our parcel and e-commerce activities primarily in international markets.
Operating cash flow increased by around 35% as a result of a very good trend in working capital.  And the increase in CapEx by more than 68% from an, admittedly, low level last year, is mainly directed towards expanding the domestic and international parcel infrastructure.
And onto express on Page 21.  Express revenues and EBIT continue to reflect the strong trends we've seen in previous quarters, where we continue to grow faster than the market and have seen a strong positive development in EBIT growth and margins.
Revenue rose by 12.5% in the first quarter to EUR3.2b.  But adjusted for exchange rate effects the revenue increase amounted to 2.3%.  Adjusting for the decrease in the fuel surcharge revenue would have been significantly higher again.
EBIT increased by more than 20% to EUR332m due to the continued strong growth in TDI and the resulting positive leverage effects in our network.  As a result the EBIT margin climbed to 10.2% in the first quarter compared to the prior-year level of 9.6%.
CapEx increased year over year as we spent more on modernizing global and regional express hubs and investing in a more efficient aircraft fleet.
And on Page 22 global forwarding and freight.  In a still rather challenging market environment DGFF achieved a revenue increase of more than 7% to around EUR3.8b.  This was driven by volume growth in ocean freight as well as positive FX effects.
Nevertheless, the division's operating profit fell to EUR17m as a consequence primarily of direct and indirect costs relating to the transformation program.
With the new management in place we'll now thoroughly analyze the status of the transformation and then determine the further approach.  At the same time we are intensively focusing on improving the underlying operating performance for the division.
On Page 23, revenues in the supply chain division rose by more than 12% in the first quarter to EUR3.94b.  And adjusted for currency effects revenues rose by only 0.8%, as supply chain has a very concentrated exposure in US dollars and British pounds and so the currency effect was magnified for supply chain compared to the other divisions.
The increase reflects new business schemes particularly in automotive, consumer and life science and healthcare, and the relatively low organic growth reflects the loss of our larger customer last year in the second quarter in North America.
EBIT declined to EUR53m in the first quarter mainly due to the planned and non-recurring restructuring costs as well as small positive effects from real estate transactions that we had in the first quarter of last year.  Similarly, we expect some positive effects in Q2 of this year as we've now closed on the sale of some real estate in the UK.
With the restructuring the division intends to increase margins to 4% to 5% by 2020 based on higher levels of standardization, greater efficiency and improved benefits from economies of scale.  CapEx is higher than last year due to phasing of some investments for new contract startups.
And let's finish up now on Page 24 with a review of our guidance metrics.  And although we continue to expect global economic growth in 2015 to be only slightly better than last year, and will continue to invest heavily in the group's long-term success, we are reaffirming all of our targets for 2015.
As communicated in March, operating profit is projected to increase to between EUR3.05b and EUR3.2b this year.  PeP will contribute at least EUR1.3b, while the DHL divisions are expected collectively to contribute between EUR2.1b and EUR2.25b.
For 2016 we are maintaining our forecast of a strong increase in EBIT to between EUR3.4b and EUR3.7b, where PeP is expected to contribute more than EUR1.3b again, with the DHL divisions contributing between EUR2.45b and EUR2.75b.
And by 2020 we expect to have increased our EBIT on average by more than 8% annually from the base-year 2013.
So with the reconfirmation of all of our guidance metrics today let me close by reiterating that in 2015 we are setting the stage for long-term success of the Company.
We are taking the actions necessary in 2015, especially in DGFF and the supply chain division, to set the course for delivering on both the 2016 and 2020 targets.
Thanks for listening.  And we'll be happy to answer your questions now.

(Operator Instructions).  Stephen Furlong, Davy Research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen Furlong,  Davy Research - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, sorry.  Hello.  Yes, just on the forwarding maybe just -- I understand obviously there is the internal process [in] restructuring.  Maybe you could just give a flavor, with a new team in place, do you believe -- I guess I'm just trying to get a handle that this isn't going to be a perpetual restructuring story there.
And I know looking internally therefore the GP per tonne, particularly in ocean freight, declined a lot.  And I'm just looking for some color about how the relationship is with SAP there.
And then just one other thing on express.  And I think it's obviously happened since the last call, but maybe just Frank could just give some generic view on proposed consolidation in that market with [views] that are happening.  And does he think that's a good thing for the long-term health of the express market?  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I'm happy, Stephen, to answer those questions.  So in particular we have a good relationship with SAP, but maybe the bit broader subject is even more important.  So before we get into the sentiment that this is a restructuring story we should not forget why we are where we are.
So we believe that the business model can be improved significantly and we can make it more successful.  But I have to admit that we probably were too aspirational in changing everything at the same time.  Changing the structure it may mean through organization, changing the processes and trying to implement the new software which is significantly more rigid.
We have not -- and in hindsight you are always smarter.  We probably [had] reviewed the pilots more carefully [than] we did in the last year and had not continued to change the organizational structure, because we continued to change that to get a better preparation for the further rollout.
After we realized that a further rollout is not possible we were pretty much done with the changes.  And that has no impact on the day-to-day business.  So this is not a restructuring story.
It is to improve the business model significantly.  But I believe our timelines, what we have done to change -- that we changed so many things at the same time has overwhelmed the organization.  That's the reason why we stopped the rollout.
Now we revisit actually how we can really bring the organization in a situation that they can manage the day-to-day business better.  First indications show that this is doable and we should now continue to work on that intensively.  And Renato is traveling around the world at the moment with his team to get a better understanding.
So I believe that this is not a restructuring story.  It is more we want to make the business model better.  And this will continue our goal.  It will take longer and the path might be slightly different, but the fundamental belief has not changed.
So -- and I think we should not get into the mode that this is a restructuring story, because it was -- two years ago it was still a very profitable business and has been for a long time.  And most of the people are still around.  So it's not that we don't know how to operate that business successfully.
On express, yes, you are probably referring to FedEx and TNT.  We always have the same story around that.  Like in [this last] case, I think the authorities have to assess it very carefully.
TNT is a European company with a European airline which is not easy to operate as a US company.  There might be some markets impacted.  It will change the competitive landscape as well in Europe.
And we believe that the antitrust authorities or the commission should look into that as carefully and other authorities as well in other parts of the world as they have done that last time, and then we will see what the outcome will be.  And -- yes, and then we will see.
It's for us at the moment anyway a good situation, because it creates uncertainty for both.  You saw that TNT had not a particular thrilling first quarter.
Customers are looking for -- if they look for a safe harbor, well, they are highly welcome in our camp.  So for us it's the same opportunity as we had last -- a couple of years ago when UPS tried to acquire TNT.

Damian Brewer, Royal Bank of Canada.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  Royal Bank of Canada - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, good afternoon, everybody.  Three questions, hopefully, short ones.  First of all, just coming back to the forwarding business, could you talk a little bit more about the decline in the GP per TEU in the ocean business in particular, down nearly 14% there?
What lay behind that?  Was that pricing, or were there some mix issues focusing on large customers?  I just really want to understand why that was so different from the air business.
Secondly, European TDI volumes seem to be particularly strong given the underlying weaknesses of at least some parts of the European economy.  Could you tell us what was going on there?
Were there significant share gains?  Was there something going on with a particular part of the customer base?  And again just some more color on that.
And then, finally, in the notes in the accounts the income from provision reversals, at EUR82m, there's comments about some release of some HR-related and ageing tax provisions.
I'm wondering if Larry could give a little bit more detail on that, and whether that's now all out, or whether that is likely to continue to repeat in future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  So ocean freight and airfreight [and] any way so they collide in GP, I think it's a mixture of the remaining tough market.  But there's also a part home made.
As I said, we have changed the structure quite a bit.  And therefore in certain parts you probably lost a little bit the focus on really doing the day to day, because people were busy and changing there the structure and are preparing for the NFE rollout.
So -- and since we -- ocean freight is the area where we wanted to go live first that had significantly more impact than on airfreight.  So it's a mixture of a tough market, which continues.
We have not a very strong market anyway, but it's also, to a certain [way], home made.  It's a mixture, and that's what we are now addressing to convert at least, well, the later part, because we were probably more successful in riding the cycle in the past until 2013, so that's not a long time ago, than we are now.
On TDI, I believe that's the result of our outstanding service quality.  And therefore we are gaining [merely] market share in Europe.
The second is that e-commerce plays an important role here as well.  There is a significant demand as well.  People are willing to pay for next-day delivery cross-border and we see benefits from that as well.
But I think we are definitely the strongest player in Europe and we are gaining, significantly, market share in that field at the moment.  And if that's already -- now, it can't be a reflection of the ongoing transaction, because that was only announced during the quarter.
So I think that's the underlying service quality, but we hope that this continue -- we are confident that this can continue, because we are heavily investing in Europe as well in our expansion of capacity.  And that should help us to be the leading supplier not only in Europe, but in international business [more than] express.
And, Larry, you probably have an answer to the provision question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  So there was indeed an employee-related or a personnel cost-related release of a provision during the quarter.  I would characterize it as non-recurring in nature.
It's a rather technical one having to do with the release of a provision that we had for pension liabilities for employees that were transferred in a divestiture and where we kept some liability.
And we found during the quarter that we could reduce the provision for those liabilities.  And that's pretty much what it was, in the low double-digit million.  And I think you could characterize that as being non-recurring.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  Royal Bank of Canada - Analyst    [10]

Okay, that's great.  Thank you very much.

David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Could you first talk about the development in e-commerce parcel business outside of Germany?  You seem to be growing very nicely and I wanted to know if there are any specific countries where that growth was concentrated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  So the e-commerce business outside of Europe was especially impacted by positive currency factor.  So the underlying growth for those two businesses, the Europe and also e-commerce outside of Europe, was around 4%.  So we're pleased with that.
The biggest part of the business are still the businesses that we've transferred over from Express in mid last year.  And that's the blue dart business and India as well as in several countries in Europe, including Poland, Czech Republic and Benelux.
And we are doing well in all those business.  The transition has gone really smooth.  The, I would say, re-orientation of the business from a B2B business, in particular the European businesses, to a B2C business, and one which capitalizes very much on e-commerce, is going extremely well and is pretty much completed.
So we're very excited about the future of the business.  We announced the entry into a new country, the first new country in March, when we announced our full-year results.  And we expect to be able to give you more news about activities in additional countries in the near future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then, turning to the express division, why did staff costs rise faster than volumes this quarter at express?  I didn't know if that was currency related.
But also I saw employee headcount was up about 8% year over year.  So I wanted to know what the reason was for the big jump in headcount not just year over year, but also it was up about 4,000 people from the end of 2014.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  So at the beginning of 2016 we had a structure change where we've transferred a big group of employees, close to 2,000 employees, from our global business services over to the express division.  And that's the primary explanation for that.
The other is general growth in the business as well as the expansion of our hub facilities and the investments that we're making in particular in the UK, in Leipzig and also in Brussels.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then last question just on express yields.  How were they, I guess, on a currency-neutral basis or ex-currency, ex-fuel surcharge?  Any general comment there on the current yield environment, just underlining core pricing for express packages?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  So if you take out the factors currency, energy and weight mix, yields were quite stable in the quarter.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Thanks].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.

Douglas Hayes, Morgan Stanley.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Hayes,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, good afternoon.  A couple of questions, please, from my side.  First, going back to the forwarding division, appreciate that the big driver of the year-over-year decline was the restructuring costs, but can you give us a feel for how you expect those to develop throughout the rest of the year?
Is it -- should we see a similar sort of impact year over year in Q2 and Q3?  Or do you think it in theory should lessen a little bit?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I think -- good that you are asking.  I think it's not only restructuring expenses we have.  It is that, as I said, we are not managing as successful as we have done that until probably Q1 2014 until we started really to roll out the organizational changes in all countries.
We are not managing the business in the same way as we did, and we have to correct that now.  That's the reason why I'm talking.  So it's not only impact by the restructuring expenses, [so] also that we are not riding the cycle in this industry as successful as we have done.  And we want to correct that now.  And we are working on that at the moment with the highest priority.
In addition we will look into how we should approach the business regarding the transformation a different way.  Therefore, it's too early to say how really the investments in the change program will occur in the next quarters.
So at the moment we are holding back.  But of course certain adaptations of the software are continuing and the stabilization of the pilot countries is continuing as well.  We would prefer to tell you more when we really have a new plan instead of now guessing.
The impact year over year is not only related to the restructuring costs -- or not -- transformation costs.  Let's avoid the program -- the word restructuring, because we are not restructuring the program.  We are changing it to the better.
But what we have tried in the first place has not worked very well.  And we have to admit that.  And that's now the focus.  So -- and I believe we can change certain things pretty rapidly and that should help us to improve the underlying business [anyway].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Hayes,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  So [undoubtedly] there are some easy wins, but still some bigger issues to tackle as well?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  I think we have identified -- as I said, it's not -- nothing is fundamentally broken in a way that we don't know how to operate the business.  But we had very high aspirations.  We change the structure.  The structure is probably too much without getting a new system.
Since we stopped the system rollout we have now an organization which is not really well supported by the process in the system.  We have to correct that.  And that's a focus.
So therefore it's not that the business model as such is not working and didn't work.  It worked very well until 2013.  And we have to go back to that.  And that's the reason why we are changing that.
So I think we should avoid this -- this is not a broken business, it's is not a bad division, it's not in restructuring all the time.  Looking back into 2013 we had a very nice profitability there and we believe that we can re-establish that.  But we have to find a different way to roll out our system change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Hayes,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, great, understood.  Thank you.  Two other smaller questions then.  Can you just provide a quick update on the timetable for the labor negotiations in mail?  Are you still hoping to get this resolved by Q3?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So that's a tricky one as well.  So we -- I believe we have -- we put just last weekend a good proposal on the table, which was refused, so you never know how these things are working.  But I'm still confident that we get to a conclusion in Q3, yes.
But it's difficult to judge.  We have a fundamental discussion going on because we are changing some fundamental things, but I'm optimistic that we somehow will find a way to sort it out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Hayes,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, great, thanks.  And then I guess just finally for Larry, and looking at the taxes paid in the cash flow statements, it looks like year-over-year cash taxes went up, but in the P&L taxes were actually down.  Can you give us just a little more insight into what happened there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  I don't -- I wouldn't really draw many conclusions by the quarterly pattern of payments.  It just can happen that we need to pay certain tax bills in a quarter and then the next quarter it's lower.  And there's no particular discernible pattern.  I think it's much more informative to look at the full year.  So I wouldn't really draw any conclusions from that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Douglas Hayes,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, great.  Thank you very much, gentlemen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks.

Robin Byde, Cantor Fitzgerald.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robin Byde,  Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, guys.  Just two from me, please.  Hi, there.  Just on express, I just noticed that the Americas' TDI volume growth lagged the other regions.  So could you add a bit of color on that?  Is that the US, or LatAm, or Canada, or nothing specific?
And then, secondly, just on the civil servant pension payments that numbers only come down marginally year on year, I think, by about EUR5m.  So could you just remind us what are the drivers of potential changes in that number?  Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So let me take both of those.  So in the Americas there's probably two factors for the lower TDI growth.  One is the lower activity with the DOD as the US draw down -- draws down its activities in the mid east.  That was an important business for us and so that's reflected in the year-over-year growth.
The other factor is the weakness in some Latin American economies and -- where we've seen little or even negative growth in some of the countries and that's had an impact overall on the growth of the Americas region for Express.
So as far as the civil servant pensions, that amount that we pay is based on a percentage of the salaries for the active civil servants.  So knowing that we are not hiring any new civil servants that figure can only go down year after year with the retirement of active civil servants that we still have.
But it goes down quite slowly and we project that it will continue to be a slow decline over time and over a period of years.  And, yes, that's the driver of that figure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robin Byde,  Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thanks, Larry.  Thanks, guys.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [44]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Combe,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, everybody.  Just a couple of questions on forwarding.  Could you please confirm when exactly the rollout stopped?  And should we assume that there were any associated cost savings with respect to IT staff, or are those focused on training and rollouts?
And additionally does the complexity, that's proven challenging, has that extended into systems that were meant to support financial controls?
And, lastly, does this impact in any way joint bidding activity with supply chain?  Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  Maybe I can say something on the first, then, Larry, you on the financials and then the third on supply chain.
So we are not ready yet to tell you exactly [a] new rollout plan.  And of course therefore not when we get benefits from that.  We have to review the approach fundamentally and get to a point where we say now really the approach is digestible.
As I said, we have overstretched the organization with all the consequences we see at the moment.  I think we have to re-establish something and then we have to assess very carefully.
And we can't tell you at the moment when we really will restart and when we will see benefits from that.  I know that this is not particularly exciting for all of you, but that's the truth at the moment, that we'd better now take a careful assessment.
There is no impact on -- for supply chain somehow.  And also we continue to [sell] good business.  That is not impacted.  You have seen that our business has grown in the first quarter, maybe not as good as the market, but we have not seen that we have massive decline in revenues or volumes, which is important.
So the underlying business is still healthy.  And therefore we can also work with our supply chain colleagues still constructively together.  The overall level is very small anyway.  So there is not a significant overlap for the two divisions anyway.  So -- and maybe you can talk a little bit, Larry, about what we have -- what we see on the financials.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  So certainly in terms of the whole Company the whole division, global forwarding and freight, there's no question about the robustness of the overall financial controls.
In a handful of small and medium-sized countries we've had to work especially hard to make sure that either through the new system, or with so-called workarounds that we are doing outside the system, that were able to generate reliable financial statements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Combe,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, that's clear.  And just one last unrelated question on pensions.  Is the now rather old guidance of targeted 50% coverage of German pension liabilities still valid?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think it's generally valid that we don't want to cover 100% of German pension liabilities, in particular, now since the liabilities have been so temporarily inflated by the extraordinarily low discount rates.
I think, though, that you could assume maybe not exactly 50%, but somewhere in the mid-range percent is a good target that we'd like to have for the German liabilities.  And of course for the whole Company we are already at about two- thirds coverage and we'd like to see that maybe a little bit higher.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Combe,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [52]

Okay, thank you.

Mark McVicar, Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Barclays - Analyst    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, everybody.  I have two questions.  First one is for Larry.  Larry, could you just explain again how the currency works?  You talked about a 6% to 7% benefit from reporting back into the euro at the revenue line.  And there doesn't seem to have been any benefit on the bottom line.
And I know there's lots of natural hedging and all that kind of stuff, but it -- is there actual hedging of the EBIT back into euros which is stopping some of the natural translation effects that we've been seeing in some of your -- some other euro-reporting companies?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I think there's a number of factors.  So you've seen the very important effect that we have on top line.  At the EBIT level we're pretty well balanced.  And it relates back to a number of factors.
First, energy costs are either directly in dollars or are driven by the strength of the dollar even if they're paid in other currencies.  And of course we have very significant expenditure for energy costs.  So that's a big offsetting and balancing factors for what otherwise would be the benefits from much stronger dollar, British pound, Japanese yen and the Chinese currency.
Second factor is that while those currencies I just mentioned have been very strong, there are other currencies that we are exposed to.  And maybe we, more than any of the other competitors, because we're so international, that have actually weakened considerably versus the euro.  And I'm thinking about places like Russia, Argentina, Venezuela and a couple of others.  So that helps to balance the effects.
And finally, the last factor that you mention, we do some hedging, so nowhere near 100%, but we do hedging against a stronger euro generally.  So that when the euro weakens we get some underlying benefit from the underlying positions, but we get an offsetting negative impact from the hedge that we've put in place.
Of course, that turns out only to be a transitory effect, so if rates stay where they are that after the end of the hedging period you get the full benefits.  Nevertheless, in 2015, because we've had such a sharp move in the euro that is certainly another important factor.  So top line very important, EBIT, Everything considered, all those factors I just mentioned, it's about neutral.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Multiple speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Barclays - Analyst    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And roughly how far forward do you hedge, Larry?  A year, two years?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have hedges that go out as far as two years.  But the percent of projected exposure goes significantly down after 12 months.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Barclays - Analyst    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  That's great, thank you.
And then I have one other question, which I think is for Frank.  Could you just give us a bit more -- because you talked more today than ever before, I think, about the ambitions of PeP in the US and the rest of the world picking up DAS in India.  How do you see non-European piece of the business developing?  And what sort of significance could it reach three to five years from here?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So [my guess] that's a -- it's a little bit a tricky question.  I believe that what we are doing now is really setting the base for significant success mid term.  And I say internally all days what you should do as senior team, of course, you should operate your current business very well, but you also should create opportunities for [the long term].  And I think we are doing exactly here.
So the impact in the next two, three years for our numbers will be probably not huge.  It will be more investments and expenses somehow before we really see the benefit.  But I believe that we have the skills and the capabilities to really lay the foundation, or put the seed in the ground that in a couple of years we will see significant impact.
Is that in three years, four years, five years?  That's a little bit dependent on how much we do here and how fast we really can do and how the markets then develop.  But overall I believe signs are really encouraging, if I go into these countries and see what we are doing, that we can do a lot here.  But the impact of and the overall numbers will be limited, at least in the next two, three years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Barclays - Analyst    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure.  But do those businesses actually make any money, or are they absorbing investments at the moment?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As we said in our release, I think, they are absorbing not in a big scale, but it's overall the expenses for building something are higher than the benefits.  So therefore we have a negative impact and not a positive.  And that will continue for a while.  That's the reason why we said, yes, there is staff cost which is painful for us.  There is a material increase due to the volumes.
But there are also investments, but not as CapEx, but if you build a team and you start operating you are not investing so much CapEx.  You're really investing into teams and business models and whatsoever.
And therefore we had a negative impact.  And that will continue for several quarters.  So that will hold back our numbers as well to a certain extent but, nevertheless, it's right to do that.
We have -- that's the reason why we have started to communicate more on some numbers for the other businesses.  And we will continue.  But since we are changing in some places still the business model, we want to have a little bit more consistency before we're starting to tell you more.
But there is growth happening, and there is growth potential, and we will work out in the next quarters how we can make it more transparent to you.  But as an RV e-commerce business this -- of course, we are not walking on water either, but we believe what we see is very promising.  But it takes money in the first place.
And that's the reason why we said in this release as well, yes, there is some impact on our PeP numbers as well coming from these areas, even if they are not huge, but they have impact on our numbers and they continue -- they will continue to have so.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Barclays - Analyst    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, that's great.  Thank you both very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You're welcome.

Tobias Sittig, MainFirst Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tobias Sittig,  MainFirst Bank - Analyst    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, good afternoon.  First question I have is on the depreciation in mail.  That's been going down for two years.  I know it's due to the longer depreciation factors for the sorting machines, but when will that come to an end and when should it be going up again?
Second, minorities jumped, so the non-controlling interest.  Is that reflective of strong [effort] in China?  Or is there anything else that moved that position?
And the last one just a technicality.  Does the postplus -- does that fit into e-commerce, or into other in your PeP granularity?  By the way, I appreciate the additional granularity that you provide on the PeP division now again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Let me try to take a shot at all three of those.  So I think the depreciation in mail should -- has pretty much stabilized and won't be affected further from changing depreciation periods for main components of our fixed asset stock in the PeP division.
So from here you could expect depreciation level to be stable to very slightly increasing as we continue to invest a lot in the business.
So, yes, minorities jumped because of the very good performance in particular of our joint venture in express in China, also because of the currency effects of that performance.  So the one has pretty much moved and strengthened analogue to the US dollar.
Finally, we had a small one-off effect on releasing a tax provision that we had in China and that was part of the joint venture result as well and so all three of those things contributed to the big increase in minorities.  So the postplus result is included in the mail communication segment of our post business.  And for now that's where we plan to keep it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tobias Sittig,  MainFirst Bank - Analyst    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head, IR    [71]

Okay.  Thank you, Tobias.  And we're ready for the next caller.

Operator    [72]

Angus Tweedie, Bank of America.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Angus Tweedie,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perfect, thanks very much to take my questions.  Firstly, on PeP I was wondering if -- well, the staff numbers picked up a bit on in the first quarter.  I was wondering if you could give us some idea of how you expect that to evolve over the year.
Secondly, you mention that you put a proposal on the table to the union.  That's clearly been rejected.  I was wondering if you could share a few of the details from that with us if that would be possible.
And then finally, back on the freight forwarding division, you've clearly talked about the competitive pressures.  Gross margins keep falling in the division and across the industry.  Is there something that gives you confidence that this isn't a structural decline?  And do you see capacity coming out of the market on, say, an 18 months' view?  And do you think you'll see gross margins stabilizing?  Thanks very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, maybe you answer the first question [and] the second.  Take the first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, so I do the first and the third?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, I do the second and third.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  So -- yes, so I think the PeP staff numbers are driven primarily by the increases that we are seeing in our parcel business, parcel and e-commerce.  And as we expect to continue to see increases there we may expect to see incremental increases in headcount.
I think the headcount for the postal business, or those areas where we still have combined postal and parcel deliveries are pretty stable.  And so the increases we see are related to the increase in parcel business and we'll continue to see small increases as that business grows.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so on PeP we are still in the middle.  What I've just mentioned was that we offered them a reduction in working hours on one hand and an extension of no lay offs until end of 2018.  The other details which have been discussed I can't share.
I believe overall with the subsidiaries we have created we have now a solid base for our own development of the business, because all the strikes have materialized in the mother and have nothing to do, actually, with the suggestions or the questions with regard to the new subsidiaries, despite that they are talking about quite.
But that's clearly independent, because they have now contracts and if they cancel these contracts they have to go to all participants in the industry.  So we are not alone any longer.  It's not a contract just for our Company.  It's a contract for the whole industry in the respective regions of Germany.
And that is changing the dynamics quite a bit.  And that's the reason why we have a fundamental discussion, because we found a new way how to employ our people than we had in the past.  So therefore I think it's too early.
The structural decline in DGF I have to -- or in the industry I don't believe that.  This industry is still very fragmented, as we know, and usually fragmented industries are attractive industries, because you can make a lot.
What really has not done -- has not taken place in that industry is that the forwarders have really developed in line with what the market demands [their] business models.  That's the reason why we started the journey with our transformation.  And that's the reason why I believe that's still attractive.
So I don't believe that this is a fundamental decline, because there is still a lot of trading which is necessary, and that will continue.  There is only 25% of the major players' ownership of the market.
There are a lot of local heroes who are doing that.  So I believe that this industry has a fundamental attractiveness, particular if you look into the level of investment which are necessary to deliver good returns.
This division has delivered, in some of our competitors, fantastic cash flows in comparison to the investment.  And I have no reason to believe why that should change.  I know that some people think differently about that.  But that's true as well when you talk about any industry.  You can always say that there is a very dooming thing.
As long as people trade, as long as people have to move goods some companies will make significant money in our industry.  And this industry has been fundamentally very attractive for a long, long period.  And I can't see, just because there is more capacity, or less capacity, or customers are demanding -- I think it's also you have two adapt to business model.
And [the] industry has probably not done enough, because they were too successful.  And therefore I believe this industry is a fundamentally-attractive industry and we will find ways to make money for us as well again.  So, Angus?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head, IR    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm afraid we lost Angus, but nevertheless.  Okay, operator, do we have any further questions out there at this point in time?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, we don't have any further questions at the moment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head, IR    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right.  Well, then thanks for your interest so far.  We are looking forward, as always, to see at least some of you in the upcoming weeks on road shows and conferences.  And before we close maybe some final remarks from you, Frank.
Frank Appel Yes, I think if I take the quarter in together so I believe what we are seeing is in line with our expectations, except for DGF, where we have traded worse than we expected ourselves.  As I explained, we have now taken actions to correct that course.
We will work now on the master plan.  But overall what has taken place with the investments in supply chain to restructure the business and make it more profitable going forward, with the discussions we have in PeP, that's all anticipated and well known.  And what that has as an impact on the business we expect it to.
So I think we have a busy agenda, but we said that already last August that we will have in 2015 are pretty busy agenda.  That will not change in the coming quarters.  So don't be disappointed that we come back and say, yes, we are still busy with a lot of stuff.
I believe that we have a strong management team in all of our divisions.  And I'm particularly pleased with our new head of HR and -- because I believe we have now a very consistent view on what we -- how we should negotiate that makes the situation even more -- better for the Company I believe.
So we are -- I think we feel very much equipped despite that the short end is challenging.  But I'm very confident that we can tackle all these issues, as I -- Larry and I have laid out today.
So it is a year of transformation.  It's setting the base for 2020 success.  And I'm very confident that we can make that happen again as we did a couple of years ago.  And we set the scene for 2015.
Thank you again for listening and see you sooner or later.  Thank you.
