Good morning.
Thank you for joining us today, and welcome also to those that are joining by phone.
Almost a year ago to the day, I set out our intention to accelerate the restructuring of Barclays; to refocus our business as a transatlantic, consumer, corporate and investment bank, anchored in the two financial capitals of the world, London and New York.
To achieve that, we announced a series of strategic actions, including the reorganization of our business into Barclays UK and Barclays International.
Next, the renewal of our commitment to operate a leading, global, corporate and investment bank.
Next, the reduction of our stake in Barclays Africa, over time, to a non-consolidated level.
And lastly, the acceleration of the rundown of our non-core assets.
The Bank has made strong progress against this agenda.
Barclays UK and Barclays International are doing well.
The fourth quarter showed continued progress in those businesses, consistent with the full year numbers.
Core income was up 14% versus the same quarter last year, delivering positive jaws.
In profit before tax in the core, excluding notable items, was up 39%.
Our corporate investment bank has solidified its position in the bulge bracket.
Our non-core rundown is ahead of schedule.
And after its successful initial sale of Barclays Africa shares last May, we are now waiting for final approval from the relevant regulators of our overall separation plan so that we can begin to proceed with the next stage of our sell down, and we'll do that at the appropriate time.
We also made great strides on our structural reform plans in 2016, standing up our intermediate holding company in the US in July, in preparing Barclays UK for the legal establishment of our ring fenced Bank in the first half of 2018.
As a result, in 2017 we can begin to move on from the restructuring of Barclays.
We can shift our focus solely to the future and, in particular, to how we can generate attractive, sustainable and distributable returns at a Group level for our shareholders.
Getting to this point, however, has not been easy.
In 2016, we applied a ruthless focus to non-core, cutting the dividend to fund this critically important job.
We sold retail businesses in Spain and Italy and Portugal.
We sold card businesses in Southern Europe, insurance businesses in Spain, Italy and Portugal, the wealth management business in the US and Asia, our index business in the investment bank.
And we closed offices in nine countries around the world.
Together with an aggressive push to sell or novate other assets and legacy derivatives, these efforts reduced our non-core risk-weighted assets in one year by GBP22 billion.
GBP12 billion of that reduction came in the fourth quarter alone.
Our non-core risk-weighted assets now total GBP32 billion, which is ahead of our projections for the end of 2016.
So we now expect risk-weighted assets in non-core to be roughly GBP25 billion by June 30, 2017.
Given that progress, today we are announcing that we will close our non-core unit at the half-year, six months earlier than previously targeted.
Our half-year results will, therefore, be the last time that Barclays will report non-core separately.
From then on, our core financials will be our Group statutory financials and we will, in effect, have completed the restructuring of Barclays at that point.
We expect to reduce non-core losses significantly in 2017 and for those losses to be well under half of what they were in 2016 at roughly GBP1 billion, with most realized in the first half as we complete the closure of non-core.
All told, this Company will have eliminated around GBP85 billion of non-core risk-weighted assets and reduced our headcount through non-core by around 10,000 people in just over three years.
And we did so in a way which has preserved value and released equity to the rest of the Group.
Last year, we also announced the difficult decision to sell down our stake in Barclays Africa to allow us to deconsolidate the business as a regulatory matter.
In May, we completed an initial sale of 12.2%.
Since that transaction, our focus has been on agreeing the separation arrangements between Barclays Group and Barclays Africa.
An agreement on the terms of separation is integral to achieving the regulatory deconsolidation in due course.
Planning for the disengagement of two intertwined businesses is a complex matter which has required an extraordinary amount of work.
But I'm pleased to report that, in the last quarter, we have reached an agreement on separation terms with the local management at a cost of some GBP265 million to Barclays.
This is now with the relevant regulator, as part of our formal request for permission to reduce our position to its in-state level.
Following their approval, we will be in a position to proceed with our sell down within the timeframe previously guided to.
Based on the yearend share price and currency translation, we would expect to realize over 75 basis points of CET1 ratio accretion on regulatory deconsolidation.
This is after all the separation costs are accounted for.
Alongside our focus on non-core in Africa in 2016, our core businesses delivered strong underlying performance.
Excluding notable items, profit before tax for the core was up 4% to GBP6.4 billion, and return on tangible equity for the year was 9.4% off of a much higher equity base.
For Barclays UK, underlying return on tangible equity was an impressive 19.3% as we continued to help our customers and clients and contributed to the UK economy.
In 2016, Barclays lent GBP3.6 billion to small and medium sized business in the United Kingdom.
We wrote nearly GBP19 billion of mortgages to almost 90,000 households across this country, including to over 18,000 first time home owners.
We maintained our leading position in digital banking, and now have 9 million users across our mobile app and internet banking, as well as 3 million users of Pingit.
Personal unsecured lending topped [GBP4 billion] in 2016, with half accessed to the six click process of our mobile app.
[Contactless] transactions, where we have been a pioneer in the UK, more than trebled in value between 2015 and 2016.
Average current account balances were up 14% year on year.
We also saw debit card purchases by those customers rise 12% by volume.
Barclays processed some GBP260 billion of payments for consumers and businesses in the United Kingdom last year, with GBP1 in every GBP3 spent on cards going through our payment systems.
We enhanced our customers' experiences by introducing market-leading innovations like voice security, contactless cash, a new direct investing platform, and our collect cash management services for businesses.
I personally was especially proud when Barclays became the first major UK bank to run a TV ad on how people can protect themselves against fraud.
In Barclays International, the underlying return on tangible equity was 8%.
This includes the charge to exit 25% of our London office space, which we took in the third quarter, and the cost of the changes we are making to deferred compensation which I'll touch on shortly.
Within that number, our markets income rose 9% with credit a particular standout.
Credit was up 44% year over year, driven by strong performance in secondary credit trading and the emerging markets.
Banking income rose 3%, as we advised on three of the top five transactions globally, covering [GBP513 billion] of completed M&A deals.
We saw our advisory business in EMEA had its best year ever in 2016.
It's particularly noteworthy that, of all the peer banks which have so far reported full year 2016 numbers, Barclays is one of only a few which have seen investment banking income rise year over year; that's also on a US dollar basis.
According to Deal Logic, we finished 2016 ranked fifth in the US in terms of fee share, and third in the UK, up one spot in each from 2015.
So I would challenge the notion that only US banks gained share in investment banking in 2016.
Our consumer card and payments income increased 21%, driven by growth in all key businesses.
Loans and advances in our US card business are now over GBP20 billion.
In our payments business, we processed GBP60 billion in the fourth quarter alone, up 13% year over year.
To give some context of the relative size, our US card business is noticeably larger now than our UK card business in terms of receivables.
We remain focused on driving improved returns in Barclays International, and in particular, in the corporate and the investment bank.
However, the fundamentals of this business today, and its capacity to generate significant profits, are getting better.
Taken together, our core performance is strong evidence of the potential for this Group, and of a bright future ahead.
As we conclude our restructuring, the next phase of Barclays development becomes the priority of this management team.
Put simply, how do we position Barclays for success, not only for the next couple of years, but well into the future?
We have addressed the drag of non-core, but now we need to look ahead.
We are starting from the premise that operational and technological strength is going to be a key competitive advantage for any global bank in the future.
Our intent is to build Barclays on a foundation of world-class core operations and technology.
In the model we envision, core functions for the entire Group are standardized across the Company, streamlining costs, driving high quality analytics, and improving customer experience.
By developing a strategic data architecture, which maintains and delivers information across all of our businesses, we can provide them with the ability to use data in new and innovative ways, that allow us to fundamentally rethink the way we run those businesses, and how we serve our customers and clients.
For functions, including risk and finance, and treasury, this data architecture will also help to improve the quality of the Group's capital allocation, and strengthen our risk management.
By creating shared utilities as the foundation of our Company, we can generate efficiencies from scale while, at the same time, ensuring that we deliver world-class customer experience, which we believe is key to driving loyalty and long-term growth.
This model also allows us to simplify core processes across the Bank, everything from how we handle complaints or fraud, to how we onboard a client.
If you then layer our diverse set of market-leading consumer and wholesales businesses on top of the state of the art foundation, the prospects for them are truly exciting.
Our core businesses are already high quality and characterized by deliberate diversity.
We have a diverse product set; from institutional advisory to international cards and payments, from equity capital markets to corporate lending, from macro to mortgages, we are extremely well positioned across the consumer and client continuums.
It's worth noting that around 53% of our income in 2016 was from our consumer business, whereas 47% was from our wholesale businesses.
This balance between the two is a huge strength for Barclays, giving us opportunities for growth across a wide waterfront, and resilience in earnings if one side of the mix comes under pressure.
We are also well diversified geographically, and this gives us the benefit in both exposure to different economies and a significant mix in terms of currency risk.
Last year over one-third of our income, roughly 35%, came from the US, and with the dollar strength relative to sterling, this was even more valuable to the Group.
Our deliberately heavily weighted exposure to the transatlantic developed economies of the US and the UK, with strong wholesale and consumer businesses in both geographies is, we believe, a unique and attractive banking model.
It gives Barclays the capacity to generate strong sustainable returns at a Group level, through any cycle, especially with the reinvestment capacity we expect to generate through cost savings from the single core operational foundation that we are building now.
If built right, that foundation of shared core operations and technology is scalable, giving us optionality for the future in terms of organic and inorganic expansion.
And it is the reason why bringing Paul Compton in as our Chief Operating Officer, in the middle of last year, as well as hiring a new Chief Technology Officer, a new Chief Data Officer, and a new Chief Risk Officer, was so critical for the Company's future.
Costs remain a priority for management, and we continue to target a Group cost to income ratio of below 60%, over time.
We are confident, however, in our ability to deliver on that target, given that the core cost to income ratio in 2016 was already 61%.
We will carry on driving efficiencies where we can, with our priority being to use additional savings beyond our target, to reinvest in the business and its supporting technologies.
Core costs for 2016 indeed exceeded our previously stated GBP13 billion target by some GBP400 million.
Exceeding that target was my decision.
In December, we identified the opportunity to address some longstanding practices in the way we treat deferred bonuses, which reduces the operational leverage we should have in this Company.
Under existing deferral arrangements, there's currently a limited relationship between the performance costs booked at Barclays each year, and any changes made the bonus pool related to that year's performance.
This is a consequence, in part, of overall levels of deferral in prior years, as well as the way in which those costs of those deferrals has been recognized in our accounts.
As a result, whilst shareholders experienced the full impact of a fluctuation of in-year revenues immediately, the effect of related decisions on bonuses, which should offset some of that revenue fluctuation, was spread out over future years.
To correct this, we are changing the timing of the accounting for those deferrals, as well as aligning overall levels of deferrals and the compensation plans across the Group, making them more consistent with our peers.
The net effect of these changes is that where previously shareholders, in year, saw virtually nothing of the benefit from a declining bonus pool, now they will potentially see around 80% of the benefit of such a decision in year.
This will greatly improve our operating leverage.
It is in our shareholders' interest to have a strong relationship between in-year revenues and in-year bonuses.
But fixing this issue meant taking the GBP325 million increase in costs that I noted in 2016.
I decided that that was the right thing to do for the Company, despite the impact on our 2016 cost target, and it places the Group on a much better footing, going into 2017 and beyond.
To be absolutely clear, the overall bonus pool for 2016 is down year on year, despite profits being up.
And that is after we've already absorbed a very significant currency headwind from the strong US dollar.
But if we see opportunities similar to this one in the future, which we believe are the right thing to do for our shareholders' long-term interests, this management team will take those decisions.
Continued progress on our 2016 priorities, together with the organic profit generation, has strengthened our capital position in the year.
We generated 100 basis points of additional CET1 accretion, in 2016, to print a very strong 12.4% ratio at the yearend.
This progress demonstrates, once again, the underlying earnings power of Barclays, and the Group's effective capital management.
Tushar will give you some further detail about how our expected capital trajectory is in his remarks shortly.
But what should be very clear is that the Company has a strong capital position today and a very good ability to generate further accretion down the road.
We are, consequently, well positioned to absorb any headwinds over the next few years, as well as to take advantage of opportunities which makes sense in terms of future profitability.
Headwinds may include regulatory changes like IFRS 9; potential changes to risk-weighted asset calculations.
Others could arise from conduct matters, which we haven't forgotten about, which we still need to resolve.
Or in relation to macroeconomic or political developments.
But regardless of the sources, we have incorporated these challenges into our planning, and believe we are well prepared for what lies ahead.
At the appropriate time, we will, of course, update our shareholders and the market on our approach to investing and distributing the sustainable ongoing excess capital which we will generate as a business.
Confidence in our past allows us to start to take advantage of capital as a strength of Barclays.
As an example of this, we recently gave notice that we will be using some of that current capital strength to call one of the two remaining dollar preferred shares, equivalent to just under $1.25 billion.
This will add about 0.05p per share to earnings, in perpetuity.
The ability to take advantage of an opportunity like is a result of the choices we made last year.
They were the right calls, and they have put us on a path to complete the restructuring in 2017, and to focus only on the future of this Bank.
For me personally, it's been an extremely busy, yet rewarding first year.
I am continually amazed by the talent that we have within Barclays, and the dedication people show to this institution.
From my perspective, it is one of the Company's greatest assets.
But now on to 2017.
First, we will close our non-core unit early, and when we achieve that in June, we will no longer be a Bank in restructuring.
Second, subject to regulatory approval, the next stage of our exit from Africa is ours to complete, and we will do that at the appropriate time.
Third, we will continue to execute the development of our Company's core operations and technologies as the foundation of Barclays' future success.
Fourth, we will grow our capital to our target end state, as soon as possible.
And lastly, we will continue to drive the diverse set of businesses that make up our transatlantic, consumer, corporate and investment Bank, to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders.
We are now just months away from completing the restructuring of this Bank, and I am more optimistic than ever of our prospects for 2017 and beyond.
So thank you.
Now let me hand it over to Tushar, to take you through the 2016 numbers in some more detail.
Thanks, Jes.
I'll spend a couple of minutes summarizing the financial highlights for the full year, and then focus on the Q4 performance across the businesses.
We have, as usual, highlighted notable items, and I'm pleased to say that we haven't adjusted for anything material in Q4, although we have called out the additional GBP395 million additional compensation charges that Jes referred to earlier.
When I run through the performance of the businesses, I'll talk on an underlying basis, excluding notable items.
Full year core RoTE dipped below double digit, at 9.4%, but that figure does include the additional compensation charge, and reflects the significant increase in equity allocated to the core.
The core businesses have shown great resilience in a year of significant political and macroeconomic events, with Barclays UK reporting an RoTE of 19.3%, and Barclays International 8%.
Our CET1 ratio strengthened significantly to 12.4%, up 80 basis points in Q4, making an increase of 100 basis points for the year.
This is strong evidence of our organic capital generation, and underpins our confidence in reaching end-state capital levels.
We've announced that we're closing non-core unit ahead of plan, at June 30, with RWAs expected to be around GBP25 billion, and losses reducing significantly in 2017, leaving a reduced drag to be absorbed by the core businesses following closure.
As we switch our attention to running the Group as a normalized Bank, we remain very focused on costs.
Having achieved a 61% core cost to income ratio for the year, with positive jaws, we are on track to achieve 60%, or a sub-60% level, for Group cost to income ratio in a reasonable timeframe.
Before I go into the underlying results, a word on statutory outcome for the year.
These numbers show the benefit of the significant reduction in the headwind from notable items, down GBP2.9 billion net to a negative GBP420 million.
We've shown the breakdown of these items in the appendix.
Group statutory profits before tax more than doubled to GBP3.2 billion, resulting in an attributable profit of GBP1.6 billion and a Group statutory RoTE of 3.6%.
We've declared a final dividend of 2p, making 3p for the full year, as previously indicated.
Tangible net asset value per share increased 15p, to reach 290p at yearend.
Turning now to the full year and Q4 core results on an underlying basis.
Our core businesses increased underlying profit before tax by 4% to GBP6.4 billion.
And generated an RoTE of 9.4%, on an average tangible equity base that was GBP4.1 billion higher year on year.
Core income increased 7%, with strong growth across Barclays International, which benefited from the stronger dollar, and flat income in Barclays UK, despite the headwind from the UK base rate cut.
Costs were up 6%, with currency headwinds and the additional compensation charge in Q4, partly offset by cost savings across Barclays UK and CIB.
But this still delivered positive jaws across our core businesses.
Impairment rose by GBP623 million, from historical low levels of last year, driven significantly by modeling updates in our UK and US card portfolios.
Delinquency trends are not causing us a concern, although higher in US cards, reflecting a change in portfolio mix.
The core tax charge increased 28%, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30%.
This reflected the introduction of the 8% surcharge in the UK and higher tax rates currently prevailing in the US, where we generate significant profits.
On the right-hand side, you can see the Q4 core numbers.
As you know, there is some Q4 seasonality, including the bank levy, which we can't accrue through the year.
So the core delivered just under GBP600 million of attributable profit, while PBT was up 39% year on year.
Core income was up 14%, while costs were up 13%.
Both reflected the 18% Q4-on-Q4 strengthening of the dollar.
The core cost line also included GBP390 million of the additional compensation charge.
Excluding this, underlying costs were down in constant currency terms.
Overall, the combination of that charge and the Q4 bank levy took core returns below the double digit that we have often referenced.
But as you can see from this slide, returns have been pretty consistent, despite the significant increase in equity allocated to the core.
Moving on to the performance of each of the core businesses, and beginning with Barclays UK.
Income was flat year on year, while costs reduced to 1%, delivering slight positive jaws, and a cost to income ratio of 58%, reflecting Q4 seasonality.
The full-year cost to income ratio was 53% and we still aim to get that down to below 50%.
Headline impairment for Q4 decreased 18% year on year.
As a result, we reported a 7% increase in PBT and a RoTE for the quarter of 17.1%.
Full year RoTE for Barclays UK was 19.3%.
Looking more closely at the income line, both non-interest income and NII were broadly flat.
NII accounted for over 80% of income and reflected a net interest margin of 356 basis points.
This was down on the Q3 level of 372 basis points, which included some one-off treasury income, but slightly higher than we guided to at Q3, resulting in a full-year NIM of 362 basis points, up 6 basis points on the year.
I'm pleased that NIM has been pretty stable as we have maintained pricing discipline in a low rate environment.
We continue to estimate a range of 350 to 360 basis points for 2017 and that's assuming no base rate moves.
Our digital business continues to grow strongly.
Digital unsecured lending was up by over 40% for the full year, with over GBP2 billion of loans originated.
And we are now extending this capability into business banking.
We continue our strategic focus on, and investment in, automation, digitization and data analytics, creating further opportunities for further structural cost reductions.
Together with our strict pricing discipline, and prudent growth, this makes us confident of being able to sustain attractive levels of returns.
Turning now to Barclays International; it reported year-on-year income growth of 21% in Q4, reflecting the stronger dollar and underlying growth.
PBT was GBP373 million, down slightly year on year, but this reflected the majority of the GBP395 million additional compensation charge, without which PBT would have nearly doubled.
Drilling down into the performance of CIB and consumer cards and payments.
The CIB generated strong income growth in Q4 of 21% year on year, reflecting both the strengthening of the dollar and improved performance in both markets and banking.
Markets income was up 31%, with strong increases across all businesses.
We're pleased with our share of the flow businesses across markets, as we continue to focus on sustainable, client-driven business, and maintain tight control over inventory levels through a volatile period.
Banking was up 14% overall, with banking fees up 42%, driven by advisory income, reaching its highest level since the first quarter of 2014.
The banking fee growth was partially offset by margin compression in corporate lending and transactional banking.
And, of course, these income lines have relatively little limited dollar component compared to markets and banking fees.
Overall, a good income performance, up 21%.
And while the cost increase was 26%, this reflects the additional compensation charge, without which we would have produced very strong positive jaws.
Impairment had a limited impact on the CIB results in the quarter.
Yearend RWAs were up 7% on December 31, 2015, reflecting dollar strength, but were down on Q3.
Clearly, the negative return reported in Q4, and a 6.1% for the full year, aren't where we'd like them to be.
But looking through the deferred compensation charge, I think we're making encouraging progress, and are confident as we enter 2017.
Consumer cards and payments had another good quarter, with 22% income growth and strong, positive jaws, driven by robust performance across international cards, payments and our international private banking business.
We're, of course, keeping a close eye on impairments, which was up year on year on a loan book that grew 24%.
This continues to reflect the shift in mix of cards that we referred to at Q3.
However, the higher risk portfolios are performing well on a returns basis.
And we do expect some rebalancing over the next few quarters, as the effect of the renewed American Airlines deal comes through.
So I'd expect some move towards a lower risk mix in 2017, and for that to be reflected in the impairment charge.
Overall, PBT was up 4%, delivering a return of 13.2%.
And we continue to view this business as providing further growth opportunities, not only in international cards, but also in payments and private banking.
Turning now to non-core; I'll quickly summarize the financials, but then focus on the forward trajectory, as the reduction in returns drag is key to the Group returns profile.
Here we've shown Q4 against Q3 and also the full-year comparison.
The full-year loss before tax was up from GBP1.7 billion to GBP2.8 billion, as we accelerated the rundown.
This also reflected our decision to take all the exit costs above the line this year, as last year we charged close to GBP900 million as notables.
The attributable loss was GBP1.9 billion for the full year.
And the Q4 loss before tax was just under GBP800 million, as we took significant exit costs, on derivatives in particular.
This helped us take RWAs down to GBP32 billion, despite currency headwinds, with a reduction of GBP12 billion in Q4.
The Q4 reduction reflected completion of business sales, with a GBP3 billion reduction in the quarter, principally Southern European cards and Asia wealth.
And progress on derivatives rundown, which delivered a further GBP5 billion reduction.
We've also reduced the operational risk RWAs allocated to the non-core by GBP4 billion, which recognizes the rundown of non-core assets.
Of course, these RWAs have been reallocated back to the core, as our total Group op risk RWAs have not reduced.
We plan to close the non-core unit at June 30, with around GBP25 billion of RWAs.
The principal residual assets on closure are expected to derivatives, portfolio of Italian mortgages, and the ESHLA portfolio of high quality sterling loans.
There will also be some op risk RWAs remaining that will be absorbed back into the core, plus some capital deductions, principally PVA.
But overall, the capital tied up in these low-yielding assets will be a single-digit percentage of the Group's capital.
We've also shown the quarterly income on this slide, highlighting the significant negative income in Q4, driven primarily by exit costs as we accelerated the derivatives rundown.
You can see here that the full-year income was GBP771 million negative, excluding the ESHLA fair value moves that caused a lot of noise in H1, but which are now much less volatile.
We're pleased with the outcome of the 2016 rundown, and while we have further exits to complete in 2017, we expect a much smaller negative income.
Costs were GBP1.8 billion, but with costs in disposed businesses coming out, and the non-recurrence of the GBP400 million of restructuring, we expect a significant reduction this year.
So overall, we expect the loss before tax from the non-core assets to be in the region of GBP1 billion in 2017, and that will be roughly half negative income and half costs.
The total losses will be skewed towards H1 with the balance being absorbed into the core in H2.
For 2018, we're indicating a further reduction in negative income, and in operating expenses, and so a materially lower loss to be reabsorbed into the core.
I'll give you more detail on the re-absorption at the half-year, but I would just note that a returns drag from lower losses and capital requirement will be reduced.
Now a few thoughts on impairment and our risk positioning.
I mentioned earlier the increase in Group impairment of just over GBP600 million was, in large part, driven by one-offs, including the review in Q3 of the impairment models across our credit card portfolios by our new Chief Risk Officer, Venkat.
Our underlying 30 and 90 day delinquency trends for our UK and US card portfolios have been pretty stable, but with increases of 20 basis points in US cards in Q4 reflecting the evolution of the business mix.
As I mentioned, I'd expect some trend towards a lower risk mix in the US in 2017, and for that to be reflected in the impairment charge.
Retail coverage ratios are up, and on the wholesale side our cautious risk appetite has resulted in limited impairment.
Since the Brexit vote we have been keeping a close eye on all leading indicators and have not seen signs of credit stress in the UK.
So in summary, we remain comfortable with our conservative risk positioning and underlying impairment trends.
Turning now to changes in deferred compensation which Jes referred to.
These changes are being made to align income statement recognition more closely to the performance awards granted.
Incentive awards were down 1% overall as we absorbed the currency headwind from the stronger dollar.
However, the changes added GBP395 million in aggregate to the compensation charge in the fourth quarter.
As a result, compensation costs for the full year were up 2% rather than down 3%.
This slide illustrates the two elements of the changes we have made.
We rebalanced the percentage of bonus awarded in deferred form to harmonize deferral structures across the Group, resulting in 30% of awards being deferred, compared to 46% in 2015.
The increased amount of in-year bonus feeds straight into the income statement, resulting in a higher charge than we would have had with a 2015 split.
So less will be carried forward, and the charging of this deferred element has been accelerated, as shown on the right-hand side of this slide.
Previously, none of the deferred awards would have been charged in 2016, whereas now, 33% hits the income statement immediately.
We'd expect lesser effects of these changes in 2017, and less again in 2018 as they take full effect.
We give the forward waterfall of unamortized compensation in the results announcement as usual, and you'll see that the stock of unamortized compensation has reduced significantly.
So other things being equal, the difference between the amount awarded and the income statement charge will reduce, thus increasing the sensitivity of the income statement to changes in performance awards.
Turning now to liquidity and funding, before I finish on capital.
We maintained a strong liquidity position through H2 in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, ending the year with an LCR of 131%.
We've also made excellent progress in HoldCo issuance throughout the year, raising over GBP12 billion of qualifying MREL across senior debt and capital.
We continued to optimize our overall funding costs in 2016, redeeming another two of our callable US dollar preference shares, and carrying out further liability management exercises on capital instruments at the OpCo level.
We're also pleased that Moody's recently upgraded their Barclays plc and Barclays Bank plc ratings to Baa2, and A1 respectively.
Turning now to our capital position; our CET1 ratio finished the year at 12.4% on an RWA basis of GBP366 billion, an increase of 80 basis points in Q4, and up 330 basis points over the last three years.
The main UK pension scheme moved from a GBP1.1 billion deficit to around flat as the rate moves of Q3 broadly reversed.
But we have also demonstrated the capital generation capacity of our businesses.
We expect a ratio accretion from the sell down of our BAGL shareholding to a level that would permit regulatory deconsolidation over the next couple of years.
As an illustration, based on the yearend BAGL share price of ZAR168 and an exchange rate of ZAR16.8, we would expect the ratio accretion to be in excess of 75 basis points.
Of course, there are a lot of assumptions which affect this number, but this does factor into account all the separation costs.
Our core businesses are demonstrating organic capital generation.
With our CET1 ratio of 12.4%, we are increasingly confident of our capital flight path towards our end-state capital level, although there remain further headwinds from outstanding conduct and litigation, and over time from IFRS 9 and potential RWA recalibration, notably operational risk.
You'll be familiar with the component parts of our potential 2019 CET1 requirement.
As you know, we're moving down a notch on the G-SIB buffer to 150 basis points but, for the moment, we are planning on using this 50 basis points to hold an increased management buffer of 150 to 200 basis points above this regulatory level.
Having taken into account the 450 basis points drawdown in the recent Bank of England stress test, we are likely to target the upper end of that buffer range, so close to 13%.
Lastly, the leverage ratio improved to 4.6%, comfortably above our regulatory minimum.
And so to recap; we continue to make good progress in delivering the plan we announced on March 1, and the diversification benefits to the Group are showing through.
The core is demonstrating its ability to generate attractive returns.
The non-core rundown has proceeded well and, given the strong progress, we are closing the unit six months early.
We've seen significant income growth in certain areas of the core, notably international cards.
But recognizing the income outlook is uncertain, we remain focused on achieving a structurally lower cost base and are on track to hit our Group cost to income ratio of below 60%, over time.
We have continued to apply our conservative risk appetite and, despite the one-off impairment in card portfolios this year, we believe our high asset quality puts us in a good position.
Our capital ratio, at 12.4%, is on track for our planned end-state level, allowing us to increasingly focus on enhancing returns as we complete the non-core closure and aim to converge Group returns to core returns.
Thank you.
Now Jes and I will be pleased to answer your questions.
I'd ask you to limit yourselves to two questions each so that we can get round to everyone.
(Operator Instructions).
Ian Gordon, Investec.
Two, please.
Firstly, on Barclays UK, I take the point that revenues have been held flat against a base rate headwind, but we've now had roughly eight quarters of no balance sheet growth.
Now that's a choice.
You're not capital constrained; you're not constrained by a fat NIM on an SVR book, so it's a choice you've made.
I think, Tushar, you used the phrase, we may be leaving some cash on the table.
So my question is, what are you going to do about it?
And my second linked question, on Brexit, to your great credit, you've not put out the same fake news headlines as your near neighbor about restructuring issues arising from Brexit.
You've also made the comment today that you've seen no deterioration in UK credit since Brexit.
If you worked at Virgin or Metro Bank, you would add the word whatsoever to that comment.
In the light of that, doesn't it reinforce the opportunity for a rethink in terms of the scale of your balance sheet ambition in Barclays UK, your high return business?
And secondly, could you just please reaffirm your comments around the limited impact from a restructuring perspective?
Why don't you do the first part and I'll do the Brexit?
Okay, so asset growth in Barclays UK, just to your first question, yes, assets have grown very slightly.
Well, liabilities have actually grown much more than assets and that's kind of interesting, just to touch on liabilities and then I'll come back to assets.
Our liability base has gone up.
It's about GBP189 billion now in Barclays UK, it's up close to GBP20 billion, I think.
And that's in the light of us actually lowering our deposit rates quite significantly.
Jes mentioned earlier that a lot of that growth you've seen in very much operational deposits for us, whether it's in business banking, current accounts, as well as some savings accounts balances.
So that's good in the sense that even in a low rate environment, we're attracting customer flows, operational customer flows, into Barclays.
On the asset side, yes, absolutely, we have some choices around them.
Margins have definitely continued to be eroded in the mortgage business.
And we've been quite cautious around that, trying not to chase low margin business all the way down.
In fact, when I look at -- in our fourth quarter, completion and mortgage margin was actually up for the first time in some time for us, actually.
So we are making that choice of trying to balance -- maximizing NII but not necessarily just chasing balance sheet growth at low margin business to achieve that.
You're right in the sense we're not as capital constrained as we may have been in times gone by, so we do have those choices.
But our objective function really is to maximize NII and that's a trade-off between volumes versus margins, and you can see us flexing our levers on that.
With Brexit again, I think we said shortly after the Brexit vote that a political shock doesn't necessarily lead to an economic shock.
And, obviously, I think you've seen a fairly robust reaction by the British consumer post the Brexit vote.
On the other hand, there is a note of caution out there which is what you're seeing in inflation.
And to a certain degree, some of the increased consumer spending and consumer credit numbers that you see is driven by inflation.
And there are some signs that consumer confidence is beginning to reflect some of that inflationary impact.
So we need to keep an eye on that but, ultimately, we're here to support the UK economy.
I think the numbers that we showed in terms of using our balance sheet for small businesses, for corporates, for unsecured lending, we will continue to do that, but in a prudent way not to risk the capital position of the Bank.
(Operator Instructions).
(multiple speakers) things like the investment bank, so now that it's with the corporate bank, it's quite hard for us to back out what you think investment banking returns are at Barclays at present.
And, Tushar, you mentioned in your speech that you think they'll improve, but what level do you think they are and where do you get them to?
And secondly, Jes, in your comments, don't only think of the Americans as gaining market share.
You say in the text you're a bulge bracket player.
You're about half the capital applied to investment banking as the big Americans.
Where would you scale yourself?
Where would you scale your ambition in investment banking as we think about how big you want to be now that you've got the capital to make the choices?
Thank you.
Yes, so on returns, we are running an integrated CIB, so there's no concept internally between you guys work for an IB and you guys work for a C.
It is an integrated business, so I can't give you that breakdown; it's not how we manage it.  6.1% on a full-year bottom-line statutory basis, we put everything in through there.
You can decide for yourselves whether you want to look through any of those items.
We, ourselves, only look through the compensation charge and a couple of other items that we consider more capital in nature and returns enhancing, so we think we're much closer to double digits.
I think what's really pleasing for us is Barclays has gone through immense restructuring in its investment Bank and it's pleasing for us to see that we're improving our market share, both in markets and in investment banking.
We broke into the top five in the US dislodging one of the Americans, which has been a preserve for them for some years, so we feel very good about market share.
We've increased our market share in the UK as well and you've seen the improvement in our markets revenues.
I still think we have opportunities to sweat the balance sheet harder.
You've got Tim Throsby sitting here in the audience who's very skilled at that.
And I think we've done some of that, but I think there's still more we can do, particularly as you integrate the corporate and investment Bank further together.
I think there's opportunities there.
We're also in the peak point in our cost cycle probably.
We've got structural reform costs probably at their peak year.
We're having to ring fence in the United States, run CCAR for the first time and, for those of you that know all about that, you can understand how [expensive] that is.
So I think the prospects for us are good and what's pleasing to me is I can see that the improvements in market share are dropping to the bottom line.
And even changes in the deferred compensation program will allow us to reflect more of that in year.
As I said, first and foremost, we absolutely have to run an investment Bank which is safe and stable.
And we will manage our risk in the investment Bank so that it never threatens the stability of this Bank.
That aside, as we've said since March 1 of last year, the foundation of our strategy is having a balance between consumer and wholesale.
And as we showed up there, basically our balance right now is roughly 50/50 in terms of revenue.
We never want to get that out of kilter.
So we want to be a bulge bracket global investment Bank, but within a context of having a balanced business between Barclays UK and Barclays International, our consumer businesses and our wholesale business.
It's that balance which I think gives a particular attractiveness to Barclays as a Bank.
Yes, the final comment I'd make on that is we put up that slide quite deliberately because if you go back, I think it was for three years, we showed core returns, capital allocation we've had in the core, has tracked at about 10% on average quarter by quarter with actually not that much variability.
You've got things like bank levy and things like that that come in and out, but by and large, it's been quite stable.
And that's quite important for us, that stability, but it's on the back of, obviously, profits growth because the equity being allocated in the core has tracked up.
So we feel that we really can achieve that, continue to track that profits growth to generate an approximate double-digit return with the capital allocation we've got.
And hopefully, that -- you've seen that stability come through in Barclays as an overall Group.
And sometimes consumer bank business will earn more than wholesale businesses; I'm sure the reverse of that will be true at some point different in the cycle.
Chira, Bernstein.
Two questions.
One, instead of putting it in the investment banking side, the split between the geographies, UK and the US.
Now, lots of people are very excited about the US recovery, both in the consumer side as well as the midmarket and investment banking side.
So the question to you, Jes, is if the US actually clocks a 4% GDP and we see the enthusiasm play out in the next two years, will you be willing to move capital from the Group incrementally into the US?
How should we think about capital allocation and the way you think about movements?
I understand the 50/50 split, but be great to get some color on the geography.
And the other thing is, you showed 35% of income from the US.
Tushar, what percentage of the tax base is the US as well?
That would be great to have that number, given all the tax regulations out there.
Chira, you would argue now that we're investable.
I think we have been very clear that we like the balance of our portfolio, and being a transatlantic bank is the core of our strategy.
We will always look at profitability and return on equity and allocating capital.
We've said our receivables and our US card business now exceed our receivables in the UK card business.
We put an investment in to get the American Airlines portfolio last year.
We'll continue to pursue opportunities like that.
So it's our obligation, as management, to apply capital in the way that gives the best returns for our shareholders.
We think, at the end of the day, we are a British bank; we are anchored here in the United Kingdom.
We think there are great opportunities here and we want to keep that balance.
And hopefully, if there is an economic engine coming out of the United States that spreads and has a global impact and we benefit from it globally, but you won't see us get out of balance.
We're not going to be -- we're not going to chase a monoline opportunity just because, for a short period of time, it's got nice returns.
And the tax rate, we don't break out -- that's the point of your question, we haven't broken it out so I won't quote it on a call like this.
But it's interesting for us.
We are profitable in US dollars.
You can see that, obviously, with the currency tailwinds you see now for the pretax profits.
So any improvement in the tax regime in the United States will be very, very helpful for us.
The devil's going to be in the detail, though.
There's all sorts of things being mooted and it's too much speculation to really decide what's going to happen and when it's going to happen.
Jonathan Pierce, Exane.
Can I ask you two questions?
The first is a simple one on the AFS gains which exceeds or I think were about GBP300 million in the year.
Is that entirely in core and whereabouts in core does it sit?
Is it all head office or somewhere else?
You're getting into the weeds a bit.
You've been in the archives too long (laughter).
So most of the AFS gains are really through our treasury operations, so yes, mostly through our core business.
Yes.
Okay, thanks.
The second is a broader question on the capital trajectory for this year.
There's a couple of things obviously happening this year.
You've already redeemed one of the [prefs] which I think is about 10 basis points.
The next one, the final big one, looks to be about 20 basis points which, given your comments, sounds like that's coming this year as well.
Good thing to do, obviously, but that's a 30 basis point headwind in total.
On top of that, I'd just like to understand a bit better the pension fund because now the UK retirement fund is pretty much break-even, it looks like you're going to have to contribute GBP1.25 billion this year, which will create a surplus but that will be taken out of capital.
It will obviously debit cash and that's another 30 to 40 basis points headwind to the capital, presumably, if the math is right.
So can you confirm that those two things together could provide a headwind this year of maybe 70 basis points to the Equity Tier 1?
And maybe just framing the question in terms of the dividend as well.
What's your current thinking on the resumption of dividend growth?
Why don't I cover the capital things and Jes may want to put a word on capital distribution.
We're not going to comment on whether we're calling any other or any other liability management exercises but the math you laid out is the math you laid out.
It'll very much depend on the currency rate prevailing as to what cost it would be to redeem that particular [tranche] or whether that's something we choose to do.
Of course, there's a waterfall of things we can do with any capital that we have.
You've seen us take real estate actions; you've seen us take liability management exercise; you've seen us change deferred compensation for parts of the business we think we can invest as franchise [manners].
So there's a waterfall of things we can do and you'll see us cover all of those actions.
Some are only available to us at certain points in time, like real estate.
Some are there every single quarter, if you like, like in LME.
In terms of the pension fund, you're right; you're going back to the deficit recovery plan from the last triennial.
We're in the current negotiations of our current triennial.
Assuming nothing changes, then you're absolutely right, we have a contribution to make, as you pointed out.
And given that we're in -- well, we're roughly flat at the moment, we're in a slight surplus, it'll be straight out of our capital account.
That's totally within our capital projections when we run our own capital plans of how we get to our end-state capital position.
We've taken all of that into account.
And of course, we have to make a whole bunch of assumptions on other stuff that we don't know, like how IFRS 9's going to be handled by regulators and whatever.
We've tried to be prudent in all of our assumptions and we feel we get there quite well.
In terms of the dividend, obviously the dividend policy is the purview of our Board and our Chairman is here today.
Right now, we gave guidance for 2016 and 2017 at 3p.
I would say we're accelerating non-core.
I think at the right time we'll be talking to our shareholders about the dividend policy, going forward.
(Operator Instructions).
Two questions, if I may?
The first one is maybe if you could give us a little bit of an update on where you are with the DoJ and the RMBS suit, and where you are on PPI and if you think we've taken the last charge there?
So maybe just a little bit of color on the litigation side.
And the second one is, as we understand that the new administration in the States is quite keen to hear from banks as to what types of financial regulation they don't like, what changes could be made?
And I just thought I'd maybe ask you what pieces of US regulation don't you like and might you prefer to be changed?
Thanks.
Well, on the DoJ and our general counsel is here, obviously we did not reach a settlement at the end of last year.
I think the only public comment that we've made is, what we wanted to do is be treated fairly with respect to how the US banks were treated and leave it at that.
On PPI, I think we feel that we are properly reserved at this level and let's just see how the PPI issues unfold over the next couple of years.
But right now, I think we have the right levels of reserves.
Vis a vis US regulation, clearly, the banking system is significantly safer today than it was going into the financial crisis.
I think the banks are performing reasonably well within the scope of Dodd-Frank.
And besides that, we're really not going to comment on any specific part of that legislation.
But overall, we are encouraged by how the banking system is significantly -- we are a counterparty to all the major banks and so having a safer banking system helps Barclays as well.
Michael Helsby, BAML.
I've got a couple of questions.
First, on the incentives, can you tell us how much of the GBP1.5 billion resides in CIB, because now we can work out next year's impact, whether you'd expect the compensation relative to income to be broadly stable?
That'll be helpful.
Yes, I'll cover that now.
It's actually in the REM report, in the Annual Report, I'll point you to the page, it's just under GBP900 million.
Thank you.
And you mentioned, Tushar, in terms of future headwinds on capital IFRS 9.
Jes, I think at your own conference in September you were asked what you think is the biggest headwind for capital for the industry, or for European banks I think it was and you said IFRS 9 was your bet.
So with that in mind, if it was brought in today, I'm sure you've run some numbers, what do you think the impact would be for Barclays in terms of capital and book value?
Thank you.
You know I won't disclose that, but the thing we don't know is whether there's going to be any transitional framework as it comes in.
As an accounting matter it's definitely coming in and that will take book value own.
I won't quote you the number because we're still a year away from putting that change through.
So I suspect, like other UK banks and probably other European banks, before we get to the end of the year we'll update everybody on that.
In some ways, the most interesting thing for us is the capital effect because that's the one thing we just don't know.
You've seen in the CRR II draft legislation there's talk of a transitional phasing-in approach.
Whether that makes it into the final legislative text remains to be seen.
We know that's something that the Bank of England are keen on, and other folks.
But that's a thing that we're most closely watching.
In our own assumptions, we've taken the most prudent case and run our projections and we'll manage on that basis unless we're told otherwise.
I think the regulators are recognizing how extraordinarily pro-cyclical IFRS 9 would be in its current form.
Thank you.
Martin Leitgeb, Goldman Sachs.
Can I also have two, please?
The first one is on your US IHC, and if I read your latest filings there, they show that you have injected around $1.4 billion in capital; half of its roughly equity, half of its in form of AT1s, which puts your leverage ratio in the US to 5.7% and the Core Tier 1 ratio at 11.2%.
If I compare these to US peers, but also select European peers such as UBS and BNP, the capitalization then of Barclays IHC at this point in time seems meaningfully below that of those peers.
And I was just wondering if you could shed a bit of light on your capital plans there; what kind of capital levels are you targeting, do you want to grow there by retained earnings and over which time period, or should we expect further injections over there.
And the second question is on your FICC revenue line for the fourth quarter.
If we look at it in terms of US dollar you're up 9% year on year, and this obviously compared to the ESP is up 43%.
And the 9% actually is quite identical with that of one of your European peers, for which there were considerable counterparty risk concerns over the quarter.
Could you just shed a bit of light what held you back in the fourth quarter and how would you think of performance, going forward, there?
Thank you.
Yes, so let me do the IHC question.
I think, when we compare ourselves to the other folks that have reported, there's a few things that stand out.
I think we have a higher risk-weighted asset density than many of the other Europeans and I think, uniquely, we're profitable which it [doesn't appear] that the others are as well.
So with that in mind, and also with our own capital projections, you'll see us get to what we consider to be the right capital level to ensure that we're appropriately capitalized in advance of the 2018 CCAR run.
And we feel pretty good about getting there, so I'm not going to quote a number out there; that's guidance we need to give.
But we know where we need to get to, we know what we need to get to, to get through the CCAR process and pretty confident we'll get there in good time.
(inaudible - microphone inaccessible) injection from here, or is it mostly organic then in terms of the (multiple speakers)?
Well, as I say, we make profits and we have the ability to inject capital, but I'm not going to go into any more than detail now.
You'll see the quarterlies as they come out in the [Y19] report.
But we're pretty confident we'll get there in good time, and we're running a private CCAR this year actually, and that'll give us a lot of feedback if we need to make any amendments to the plans that we currently have in place, which we've already, of course, shared with the appropriate regulators.
The binding constraint in IHC will be the CCAR process, so we'll see how that plays out.
In terms of the FICC revenues in the fourth quarter, as we've said all during the year of 2016, we run actually very light market risk RWAs in our investment bank.
And I think, clearly relative to some [others], what that does is it means that we have less data, I think, in our IB than many of the other creditors.
So when you see the direction of the markets, like you saw in the first quarter of last year, head south, on a relative basis we did extremely well.
When you see a recovery it made in the fourth quarter, we're going to lag those -- most people that put more capital on a desk than we do.
But we like the amount of capital that we have deployed in investment bank, we like where we are positioned right now, and we'll take those swings and [probably] have less data and more assets to our portfolio which we're comfortable with.
Yes, you saw that in the second quarter as well when you saw an asset price risk on environment and people that run larger inventory positions that we do will see that in their income prints.
But the stability of our revenues, I think, is something we find quite interesting relative to others.
Particularly, if you look at this last year virtually every quarter [seasoned] markets were almost within GBP100 million of each other, which is quite consistent with those that were a bit more up and down with asset price market moves.
Andrew Coombs, Citi.
Two from me; one on US cards and then one on the structural hedge.
On the US cards portfolio, you obviously had elevated Q3 provisions due to the true up.
Q4 also looked quite elevated and you referred to a mix shift in the portfolio.
But perhaps you could elaborate on how much is mix shift versus how much is underlying trends there?
Also on that note, you talked about a reverse trend in 2017 in terms of mix shift, so again, perhaps you could elaborate?
And then second question on the structural hedge.
Your net structural hedge contribution actually ticked slightly I think, GBP0.1 billion, so interested there what's driven that; did you mean the nominals gone up as opposed to the rate?
So if you could just give more detail on the outstanding book and then also current rates versus what you're reinvesting at?
Thank you.
So on the US cards portfolio, yes, the business mix is something that we knew was coming in the second half of the year.
One of our larger portfolios in the US business is the American Airlines portfolio.
We've had it for some time; it's a very seasoned portfolio.
And of course, that came up for renewal and there was discussions with American Airlines and, indeed, we had the US Airways component of it, Citibank had the American Airlines, so it was a three-way negotiation.
So the result of that, their production origination in that portfolio just slowed down.
So the rest of our book, of course, continued to grow and we've got some [marquee brands] there whether it's Apple, LLB and stuff you've all heard of.
But the American Airlines portfolio is super-prime so just by having that production slow down, and it being a reasonably meaningful component in our business, our mix just naturally shifts without really doing anything else.
Underlying delinquencies have ticked up.
I think you've seen that across -- I looked at all the other US banks, I think across the sector delinquency trends have ticked up.
It is quite small, so these are off low, low levels as well, so I think we should be careful to extrapolate at this stage as to whether there's something more there going on there.
We're on very low levels and only a real small tick up.
For us, we ticked up slightly more than other banks, only because our mix shifted more appreciably than others.
Returns were great; we're very, very happy with the risk profile that we're running.
But I think as we see the American Airlines activity come back on, because it's a sizeable portfolio, the mix will shift again.
It'll go to a higher credit scoring mix, if you like and that will be reflected in the impairment charge.
We want to grow the book, so that's not telling you that impairment charges are necessarily coming down, but it will tell you that the type of impairment charge will be reflective of that risk mix.
Returns are pretty good, so we certainly don't feel at all uncomfortable with the way that book is performing.
Your other question on the structural hedge; structural hedge was roughly flat, rounding probably between last year and this year.
It's a little bit harder one to say this year because we had such sharp moves in the rate environment.
So we roll these, we call them caterpillar hedges, people have their own words, but swaps roll on and get refinanced into lower [territory].
That's just a continuous activity; it's held us in good stead, and at the current rate environment it continues to work out well.
It's reflected in our NIM.
Our NIM has been pretty stable, so I think you can see that the effect of having these structural hedges in place has helped in that regard as well.
I haven't really called out whether the nominals increased, or whether the rate change has shifted much.
But it's probably neither of those; it's just the rate going back to where they were before.
Fiona Swaffield, RBC.
I had questions on the start of the year; other investment banks have talked about getting off to an incredibly good start, I just wondered if you wanted to make a comment.
Also, in terms of credit, which was incredibly strong in 2016, whether you see that as a repeatable number?
We won't comment on January, February.
In terms of credit, obviously we're very pleased with what we did on our credit business last year.
Obviously, leveraged finance as well.
I think we've made terrific inroads last year with the sponsors community, from Apollo to Blackstone, etc.
We like that space.
One of the advantages of credit is, to a certain extent, there is a forward window here.
One of the realities of bonds is that they mature; generally, people have to renew them.
So you can get a fairly accurate forward calendar of maturities, and that's going to allow for stability to the credit markets.
We have a great trading desk there, Adeel Khan is very strong, so we like that business, and we like our position in that business.
There is a stability I think to the credit cycle, which similar asset classes don't have.
Tom Rayner, Exane.
Could I have two, please?
The first one just staying on the US cards book; just wondered if you could give us any color on what sort of risk adjusted margins you see on the different books within there, and whether, as delinquencies deteriorate a little bit, you can actually maybe keep that margin stable by pricing, just to understand the dynamics there, please.
Then the second question was just on the change in methodology on deferrals.
I guess, if you wait long enough, whatever you do it all washes through and becomes neutral.
But when you originally moved from a low to a high percentage deferrals, I think it probably understates the true cost of running the business.
I just wonder if what you've done today is maybe just reversing that out and actually now reflecting more of a genuine cost of running the IB rather than anything else.
Thank you.
I think on the second one, yes, absolutely.
The words I use are a little bit of a mortgaging the future, it's definitely more real time accounting, you're right.
Accounting is just timing, it's cash at the end of the day.
It's just making the timing differences on accounting matching revenues and costs, more real time.
I think you get a more clearer picture of what's really going on, so I think you're right on that.
In the US card portfolio, risk-adjusted margins are really attractive for us, and I think why that business has worked out so well for us is we've had really good pricing discipline, particularly with the partnership business, which is a strong point of ours.
We're in partnerships that are priced at very attractive levels on a risk-adjusted basis.
So when you see impairment charges go up just because of the shift in mix of delinquencies, the margins on those businesses are incredibly attractive.
And there is definitely pricing capacity there.
So depending on rate environment changes and any other changes for that matter, there is the ability to flex pricing.
And I think the business has done a pretty good job of being able to do that.
In American Airlines, production is already up and running now.
You'll just see that naturally normalize again, over time, I think.
Yes, when we were talking to shareholders early last year about the investment bank, one of the things that was deeply frustrating is, if you gave me a business model which you knew had volatile revenues but had a fixed cost number, I'd never be in that business.
And the truth is, what this decision has done for us in the fourth quarter that I will be in a business where you have variable revenues, that had variable costs underneath it, which I can use to protect my margin.
And I think that's, essentially, structurally what we did in the fourth quarter.
Okay.
Thank you.
Claire Kane, Credit Suisse.
I have a couple of questions on costs, please.
The core number for 2016 was quite good, ex the IB compensation and I guess there's some debate around how much of the non-core cost will linger when you fold it back in.
So maybe you could talk around how comfortable you are about taking out those costs longer term?
And also, how long a reasonable timeframe is to get the Group to a 60% cost to income?
And then my second part of the question is partly related to Barclays UK.
Do you see much need for investment there in the technology platform?
Do you think your mortgage offering, perhaps on the intermediary side, is a bit below peers in terms of the service and ability to take flow?
Thanks.
On non-core, how much costs will, if you like, linger in time to get the 60% Group cost to income ratio, we think, over the course of the next calendar year, it's about GBP1 billion pretax loss, half in costs, half in income, front loaded if you like,  So when you see the Group reconstituted, a little less than half of that run rate you should see flow through 2017 and then less again in 2018.
So I think you'll see a steady, steady march down.
When you look at cost to income ratio, we haven't put a clock on it, but a reasonable timeframe isn't way out in yonder and aspirational.
I think it is quite realistic.
One way of backing into it, and you've probably done this already, if you look at core income of GBP22 billion, excluding the Visa gains, so GBP22 billion this year, GBP13.2 billion in costs to get to a 60% cost to income ratio.
And you can back in from the GBP16.3 billion at the Group that we had, you take out the PPI charge, take out the litigation, I quoted to you what I think non-core will look like, you get into the high GBP13 billions very quickly, in fact the mid GBP13 billions on my math.
So it's not a long way to go to get there.
And that's assuming there's nothing else going on around the Company.
I think what's really important, and Jes may touch on this, is we do want the capacity to reinvest as well.
We just can't keep on reducing costs without reinvesting back into it, and I think that's probably the crux of your second question.
So by already being relatively close to that 60% cost to income ratio on an underlying basis allows us to continue to invest for the future.
In terms of technology in Barclays UK and [Ashok] is here and he's done an extraordinary job I think on the front end of using technology for our consumer business.
We have 5.7 million customers now bank with Barclays through this.
And if add who's transacting with us just through the Internet, that's up to the 8 million customer number that I gave you before.
We have millions of consumers making payments through the Pingit app last year.
So we think technology is a big part of our consumer offering across the UK.
I'd also say one of the things, going back to that core operations and technology that we talked about earlier, is something that I find very compelling about Barclays here is, in the UK, we go from the consumer to the small business, to the corporate, to the large institution and we go across the product offering.
And if you believe in [its intact] or if you believe in that banks are increasingly technology companies with a balance sheet, the ability to use technology innovation across the entire financial platform in the fifth largest economy in the world is a huge interesting asset, I think, for Barclays, going forward.
And I do believe on the technology front, particularly on the consumer, we have been in the front of that.
The other important thing is to use the technology to improve the customer experience.
And one of the data points that gives me comfort as we look at our business is, on average every day, 60,000 consumers across the UK get an SMS message from us saying, you're about to go overdraft.
That is 60,000 SMS messages to decrease our revenue line, but to increase the customer journey with Barclays.
Chris Cant, Autonomous.
I just wanted to come back to your comments about UK mortgage growth, or certainly a tick-up in completions in the fourth quarter.
I think you've said in the past that your UK deposit costs are now very close to zero; obviously, we've seen some front book spread compression again in terms of new mortgage pricing in recent months.
I'm just trying to think about how much growth you can actually put on whilst staying within your 350 bps to 360 bps margin guidance for next year?
I can't imagine it's too much, given the limited room for maneuver on the liability side.
Just wondering if you can flesh that out.
Yes, on that one, I must say, well this is very clear, we've seen completion margin actually tick up a little bit.
So again, it's balancing -- we're trying to make as much NII as we can.
The returns are quite attractive, so we're trying to just make the most profit that we can.
I think it's balancing volumes versus margins.
So at the moment, we have played that game quite well for us, where we're keeping our margins held up as best as we can, obviously, in the face of quite competitive pricing from others.
Operating in a part of the mortgage spectrum that's our core strength.
It's probably towards the lower end of the risk spectrum; probably more in the remortgages space, rather than in the new mortgage space.
And that's served us pretty well.
It's a good business for us and we'll continue to play in that.
We gave a 10 basis point range, 350 bps to 360 bps.
If you think of about, just quoted earlier, we printed GBP19 billion of new mortgages this year.
The book is about GBP120 billion.
Of course, you've got redemptions and everything coming off there.
So you need to be printing an awful lot of brand new mortgages at very, very low rates to start taking your entire stock of NIM down dramatically.
So it does give us plenty of capacity to flex up and down as we see fit.
Thanks.
Just following on from that, what is your back book deposit rate on the UK right now?
Deposit rate on the back book?
You mean our savings book?
Yes, your savings book.
5 basis points.
We can sign you up for a deposit account, if you're interested (laughter).
We'll sign you up for an ISA if you want (laughter).
On the non-core, you talk about the cost line coming down in answer to Claire's question earlier, but on the negative revenue side, you must have an idea the maturity of that book.
How long does it take for that negative revenue to go away?
Are we talking a decade, considering how long-tailed that derivative book is?
It's kind of [asymptotic].
You could, of course, get rid of it if you unwind every single transaction instantaneously.
Some of them are quite long dated in nature.
I think it's asymptotic, so it will continue to drift down more steeper at the front end of that timeline and it will shallow out.
And you've seen that; it's taken a lot of that steepness already.
And it will be a tail -- once it's folded back in, you should think of non-core as a little bit of a tailwind into Barclays International, because even if nothing else changes, the loss before tax of non-core, that folds back in, whereas most of it will fold back into -- will diminish over time, in a reasonable timeframe.
You'll get to the point where you'll stop talking about it, because there's other things in there that -- every business has something that isn't carrying as well as you'd like and you don't call everything out.
And just following on from Jes's comments on the UK consumer and the outlook for that.
I know that delinquency trends have been pretty good in this quarter, but how do you think about the risk in that UK consumer book?
And have you been taking actions now to offset any potential or what will be probably a wage squeeze in the UK?
Thanks.
We haven't changed our risk appetite really since probably the turn of the last cycle, since the last crisis I guess, and we've operated in that.
One of the things we haven't done is chase high margin business to protect margins; for example, buy to let or trying increase market share in first-time buyers, or areas like that.
So we've been quite disciplined in our pricing.
So I don't think our risk profile -- if I look at, for example, even commercial real estate.
You can see how small that is.
You can look through in our credit disclosures in the Annual Report, you'll see how small that is.
So I don't feel unduly nervous about anything on our balance sheet that really worries me.
Of course, if we go into a UK recession, that's not a great place to be in UK banks, but I don't think we'll do worse than anybody else.
If anything, I'd like to think we'd probably outperform in a down cycle, in a relative manner.
Thank you.
We do have one question on the phone we want to go to, right?
Joseph Dickerson, Jefferies.
You've already touched on these areas; I was maybe looking for a bit of clarity on a couple.
On the first, if you could just talk about the portfolio mix you've seen in cards.
Is this what we've seen at some of the other US issuers whereby the 2015 vintage, where a lot of players went a little bit further down the credit spectrum, this vintage is now seasoning and driving the impairments higher?
Is that the type of portfolio mix you're referring to or is it something else?
And what would you attribute the pickup in DQs to in the US, given the unemployment trends are still robust in that market?
Any color there would be helpful.
And then secondly, Jes on the ROE and the investment bank; if I back out the comp deferral change and the GBP150 million real estate expense earlier in 2016, I'm getting about a 7%, call it 7.5% ROE.
If I've backed out the bank levy I'd probably get a little higher.
How do you drive that?
Are there any further investments that are required because it seems, to drive that higher, you need to move away from flow fixed income.
So are there investments that need to make in, say, US ECM, M&A and LevFin?
Any color there would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks so much.
Yes, why don't I do the card one then.
So the portfolio mix, some of it is that sort of seasoning as you pointed out, for the 2014/2015 vintages seasoning.
So you get to peak impairment levels for those of you that know the card business, about two years in.
Of course, we did bring on a lot of portfolios at around that point and you've seen that's why the growth of our balances has gone up.
Having said that, I think what's more important for us is less so that sort of seasoning; it's more so just the fact that one of our larger portfolios just exhibited relatively less growth than the remainder of the book.
And that particular part of the portfolio was like super prime as a relative manner to the rest of our book.
So a little bit of both, but I wouldn't say it was more driven by the seasoning than it was by just the fact that our portfolio mix changed, accompanied by some seasoning of those 2014 portfolios.
Joe, I think how you bracketed the CIB is good.
I think 2016, taking out things like real estate and what not, you saw 7.5% to 8.5% ROE range and, obviously, we'd like to get a higher number to cover the cost of capital.
I do think we are competitive.
That's where most of the other players in the industry were in 2016.
The three components that we focused on is one, cost.
And a lot of what we're doing around the core architecture and technology that Paul Compton and others are focused on is the desire to reduce the costs of running the operating platform for that investment bank and we do think that there is room there to go.
The other thing that shouldn't be lost on anyone, for three years now in a row we have increased the profitability of the investment bank and taken down the bonus pool all three years.
So for those that wanted a compensation response to the profitability would be lower than we're likely to have, I think this management has demonstrated that we're willing to do that.
And the third one is this top-line growth.
And I think we showed that in 2016.
I'd make a couple of comments there.
One, an important part of our European IV platform is still new.
We are, on a relative manner, brand new to the equities business in Europe and I think there is room to grow there, on the top line.
And we're encouraged by our IB fees being a record year in 2016 in EMEA, but we have more room, I think, to go there.
And also, we do have a new management team in part coming in with Tim and I think our hope is that we can refine and improve the relative use of capital across the CIB to increase the profitability there.
Thank you.
I think with that, appreciate everyone coming down to Canary Wharf for that and we also appreciate the fact that the stock didn't go down 8% this year (laughter).
We look forward to talking to you later.
Thanks.
