Hello, everyone.
Thank you for joining us today.
I'm Tetsuya Otake.
It's my pleasure to discuss Toyota's financial results for the fiscal year, which ended in March 2017.
Let me start with Slide 5.
Compared to the previous fiscal year, consolidated vehicle sales increased by 290,000 units to 8,971,000 units.
Vehicle sales grew year-on-year in Japan, Asia and Europe, mainly driven by new models.
This more than offset the decline in vehicle sales in the Middle East, where local economies and markets suffered from weak oil prices.
Please look at Slide 6.
Consolidated financial results for the fiscal year were: Net revenues of JPY 27,597,100,000,000; operating income of JPY 1,994,300,000,000; pretax income of JPY 2,193,800,000,000; and net income of JPY 1,831,100,000,000.
Now I would like to hand the rest of this presentation to [Ms.
Morita], our interpreter.
Next, using Slide 7, I would like to explain the factors which impacted operating income year-on-year.
Despite the positive factors, such as cost reduction and marketing efforts, operating income was down JPY 859.5 billion compared to the previous fiscal year, mainly due to the continued appreciation of the yen and an increase in expenses.
Please find the breakdown of the effects of foreign exchange rates in the Footnote 1 in the bottom left corner of the slide.
There were altogether JPY 780 billion of transactional impact of foreign exchange rates involving the U.S. dollar, the euro and other currencies.
In addition, there was a translational impact of foreign exchange rate of JPY 130 billion concerning the operating income of overseas subsidiaries and of JPY 30 billion concerning the fiscal year-end balance of provisions in foreign currencies.
Please note that these translational impacts were previously included in the factors named other and increasing expenses, et cetera, respectively, but are now reclassified into effects of foreign exchange rates for better clarification.
Excluding the overall impact of foreign exchange rates and swap valuation gains and losses, operating income improved by JPY 120 billion year-on-year as a result of profit improvement activities throughout the year.
Now I'd like to break down operating income by region, and please take a look at Slide 8.
In Japan, vehicle sales increased by 215,000 units year-on-year to 2,274,000 units, driven by new models such as the Prius, Roomy, Tank and C-HR.
Operating income nevertheless declined by JPY 470.7 billion to JPY 1,260,000,000,000 -- JPY 1,206,000,000,000 due to the effect of foreign exchange rates and an increase in expenses.
Please take a look at Slide #9.
In North America, vehicle sales remained stable year-on-year at 2,837,000 units.
Operating income was JPY 330.9 billion, down JPY 174.7 billion compared to the previous fiscal year, mainly due to increased incentives and marketing activities and an increase in expenses.
In Europe, which is shown on Slide 10, vehicle sales grew by 81,000 units year-on-year to 925,000 units on the back of solid sales of the brand-new C-HR and the RAV4.
Nevertheless, operating income was down JPY 87.6 billion year-on-year to a loss of JPY 11.8 billion.
This is mainly a result of an increase in expenses and depreciation of local currencies such as the British pound and the Russian ruble.
Please take a look at Slide 11.
In Asia, vehicle sales were up 243,000 units year-on-year to 1,588,000 units, driven by new models such as the Calya, Sienta and IMV series light trucks, especially in Indonesia and the Philippines.
Operating income decreased by JPY 30.5 billion year-on-year to JPY 424.4 billion, largely due to the effect of foreign exchange rates and the decreased exports to the Middle East.
Please move on to Slide 12.
In other regions, overall vehicle sales for the fiscal year were 1,347,000 units, down 247,000 units year-on-year as a result of a significant decline in vehicle sales in the Middle East.
Operating income decreased by JPY 39.9 billion to JPY 63.4 billion, primarily due to the negative impact of increased expenses and foreign exchange rates.
Next, please look at Slide 13 for the operating income of financial services.
Operating income, excluding swap valuation gains and losses for the fiscal year declined JPY 78.6 billion year-on-year to JPY 240.4 billion.
Although the lending balance continued to grow, the cost related to residual value losses increased, as used car prices for passenger cars in North America deteriorated.
On Slide 14, equity in earnings of affiliated companies for the fiscal year increased by JPY 32.9 billion year-on-year to JPY 362 billion.
This was a result of solid performance of our affiliated companies in Japan.
Next, please look at Slide 15 on shareholder return.
With regard to the year-end dividend on common shares, we are planning to maintain JPY 110 per share.
As a result, the dividend on common shares for the fiscal year will be JPY 210 per share including the interim dividend of JPY 100 per share.
This is the same amount as the previous fiscal year.
We continue to aim at paying stable and sustainable dividends, while using the consolidated payout ratio of 30% as a benchmark.
Next, please move on to Slide 16.
We also plan to buy back up to JPY 250 billion or 50 million shares of our common stock.
Adding this to the JPY 199.9 billion of shares of common stock that were repurchased as a part of shareholder return for the first half of the fiscal year, the total share repurchase for the fiscal year, which ended in March 2017, will be up to JPY 449.9 billion or 79 million shares.
We intend to continue to flexibly exercise share repurchases to improve shareholder returns and capital efficiency.
Slide 17 shows the year-on-year comparison of our shareholder return.
In addition to the dividend on common shares, we plan to pay a dividend of JPY 105 per share on the Model AA class shares on the full year basis.
As a result, the total amount of dividend for the fiscal year to March 2017 will be JPY 632.4 billion.
Adding this to the planned share repurchase of JPY 449.9 billion, the total shareholder return for the fiscal year will be up to JPY 1,082,400,000,000 and the total return ratio will be up to 59.1%.
Now I'd like to move on to discuss the outlook for the current fiscal year to March 2018, and please take a look at Slide 19.
Consolidated vehicle sales are expected to be 8.90 million units, down 71,000 units year-on-year.
We anticipate that vehicle sales will increase in Asia and other regions such as Oceania and Africa, but decrease in Japan, where the new model effect will be diminishing, as well as in North America.
Please move on to Slide 20.
Our assumptions of foreign exchange rates are JPY 105 per dollar and JPY 115 per euro.
Based on this, our forecast of consolidated financial performance are: Net revenue of JPY 27,500,000,000,000; operating income of JPY 1,600,000,000,000; pretax income of JPY 1,800,000,000,000; and net income of JPY 1,500,000,000,000.
Please look at Slide 21.
We forecast a JPY 394.3 billion decrease in operating income compared to the fiscal year, which ended in March 2017.
Major factors are as follows: First, the negative effect of foreign exchange rates will be JPY 110 billion based on the assumption that the yen will appreciate to JPY 105 per dollar and JPY 115 per euro.
Secondly, cost reduction efforts will be undermined by the anticipated increase in raw materials cost and will be net JPY 90 billion as a result.
Thirdly, the effects of marketing activities will be negative JPY 245 billion, mainly due to an assumed increase in incentives for North America, where competition is getting tougher.
Finally, expenses, et cetera, is expected to increase by JPY 145 billion.
As a consequence, operating income excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates and swap valuation gains and losses, et cetera, is expected to be down JPY 300 billion year-on-year.
Next, please look at Slide 22 for the outlook of R&D expenses, capital expenditures and depreciation expenses.
R&D expenses are expected to increase to JPY 12.5 billion to further promote the development of advanced and cutting-edge technologies.
CapEx are expected to increase by JPY 88.2 billion compared to the previous fiscal year, mainly due to investment for the introduction of new TNG models.
We are taking the outlook of this current fiscal year very seriously.
We believe more profit improvement activities need to be further pursued.
We will strive to minimize the decline in earnings by all possible means, such as effective marketing activities in all regions, enhancement of product appeal and competitiveness, reduction of fixed costs and extensive cost-reduction activities, including VA and VE.
This concludes the presentation on the financial results for the fiscal year that ended in March 2017, and thank you very much for your attention.
