Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Deutsche Post DHL Conference Call regarding the second quarter results 2017.
At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode.
The floor will be open for questions following the presentation.Let me now hand the floor over to Mr.
Martin Ziegenbalg.
Hello, and welcome everybody out there.
Pretty straightforward event on the occasion of our half-year '17 reporting.
As flagged, we have with us our CFO, Melanie Kreis, to discuss the specific highlights of the second quarter 2017 in particular.
After that, as always, there will be time for questions-and-answers as well.And without further ado, let me hand over to you, Melaine.
Yes, thank you, Martin, and also from my side good afternoon or good morning wherever you may be and thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2017 numbers.I assume you have the presentation in front of you.
I will just quickly run through some of the key figures so that we have enough time for your questions at the end.So let's start with some key highlights on Slide 2.
When you look at the quarter, I think overall we showed again that we continue to deliver profitable growth.
Top line growth maintained good momentum, we had some currency headwinds, organically we grew with 4.9%, and we were able to translate this top line growth into a double-digit EBIT increase.Express led the way with a record margin of 12.5%.
Pep EBIT rose 4% as the Mail volume decline normalized after the relatively weak start to the year.
Global Forwarding, Freight came in in line with what we had expected after the first quarter; it's clearly still not at a level where we want it to be in the longer run.
And we'll talk more about the dynamics also in the wider market.Supply Chain continued its steady growth path.
When you correct for the cost of change one-off in the second quarter of 2016, we saw a healthy 5% EBIT growth.
So overall good progress on the EBIT side.With regard to cash flow, we will have a look at the second quarter and also at the 6 months cash generation for the half-year, which shows that our cash flow performance is strong and puts us on track to meet our full-year targets despite some growth driven working capital buildup in the second quarter.And of course we continued to expand our e-commerce footprint through targeted investments in all divisions.
Overall, I would say we saw strong progress towards our financial and strategic targets in the second quarter.Turning to Slide 3, let's quickly go through our group financials.
So I guess you've already seen the numbers, so I'll be relatively quick.
Revenue growth 4.4%, organically 4.9%; EBIT, EUR 841 million, our strongest second quarter yet.
And I think what is very nice to see here is that both PeP and DHL came in in line with our general trend expectations and contributed to the overall EBIT growth.On the financial result on taxes side, nothing surprising, they were stable and in line with what we had expected.
And on that basis, we were able to translate the EBIT development into an 11.3% growth on the consolidated net profit, which was up to EUR 602 million for the second quarter.When we turn to Page 4, you can see our cash flow for the second quarter.
I think you all remember that we had this EUR 1 billion pension funding here in Germany in the second quarter of 2016, which is of course distorting the numbers.
We have hence corrected for that to make it easier to compare Q2 2016 adjusted with Q2 2017.On this basis, you can see that on the OCF before working capital, we saw a reflection of the good EBIT development, whilst in the changes in working capital line, we saw for the second quarter standalone a buildup of working capital across most divisions.
We will take a look at that in a second on the half-year basis, which gives a little bit of a difference then.
But clearly for the second quarter, we saw a cash-out from working capital.That was balanced to a certain degree by lower CapEx in the quarter, which you will also see on the divisional numbers.
But I think overall that is more of a phasing topic, so we expect some catching up on the CapEx side in the second half of the year.On the next page, Page 5, you can actually see exactly the same picture but for the first 6 months of the year.
And I think here we had a good feeling for the underlying trend.
The first important point is that our EBIT year-over-year progress really translated pretty much one-to-one to an increase in OCF before changes in working capital.
And that is in line with what we have also said in May when we talked about our half time report.
EBIT growth will be the main driver of our cash flow performance going forward and we can see that working very nicely here in the first 6 months of 2017.On the working capital side, we always have a cash-out from working capital in the first half of the year.
But you can see that on a year-over-year comparison despite the strong top line growth, we actually had a lower cash-out from working capital, EUR 89 million less than in the first 6 months of 2016.With regard to CapEx, I talked about the short-term phasing effects and we confirm our EUR 2.3 billion gross CapEx explanation for the full-year.
So indeed that means that we will see an acceleration in CapEx then in the second half of the year as some of the big projects are continuing now into the second half of the year.The year-over-year movement in M&A then in H1 mainly relates to the proceeds from the King's Cross disposal last year, a topic you all are very familiar with.So in summary on the free cash flow for the first half year, operating performance is key and is delivering; working capital has been quite strong so far, even though we saw some growth related buildup in the second quarter; and for CapEx we will see an acceleration in the second half of the year.
Putting all that together, we see the first half of the year on the cash flow side as a strong basis to deliver on our expectation of at least EUR 1.4 billion in free cash flow for the full-year.That takes me to the net debt page, Page 6, where quite frankly there's nothing surprising on that page.
You can see our traditional second quarter pattern following the payment of the dividend, which this year, as you know, was close to EUR 1.3 billion.I think the most interesting element on this page is actually the comment at the bottom of the page, where you can see how rising interest rates are really reducing our pension liability.
So the net pension provision has come down from EUR 5.4 billion at the end of Q1 to now EUR 4.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, which implies a funding ratio of 73%.
So I think that is also quite a comfortable position to be in.That was the group overview, let me now quickly go through what is happening in the different divisions, and I will start on page 7 by taking a quick look at the quarterly results of PeP.
I naturally recall our discussions in May about the PeP numbers, where there were some questions asked after the first quarter with 3 more working days, especially on the Mail volumes, "Do we see an acceleration in the structural decline?"When we now look at the second quarter, where we actually had 3 working days less and we put the whole thing together and look at it for full-year with no working day distortions, we very clearly see that there is no acceleration compared to the historical trend.
On the contrary, the first 6 months of the year were actually quite strong.
We had put together for Mail Communication for the 6 months EUR 1.1% decline.
There were some elements from the elections in there.
But even if you're very harsh and strip all that out, we are actually with minus 2.6 taking everything out, smack on this in the corridor of 2% to 3% which we have seen historically.On the Parcel Germany side, you can see that we had again solid volume growth, 6.3%.
The revenue grew only by 1.3%.
That is something we have already commented on in the previous quarters.
We see some product mix changes here.
So that does not mean that there's an underlying deterioration of the profitability on the Parcel side.And finally, outside Germany, you can see here very strong growth numbers for Parcel Europe, 61.5%.
We had the UK Mail effect in there.
So if you look at that on an organic basis, we still see a 21% year-over-year growth for Parcel Europe and 15% growth on the DHL e-commerce side.
So I would really say that the PeP growth story on the Parcel and e-commerce side continues.
And with regard to the Mail volumes, we are back in the historical trend, and after 6 months, you can really see that the acceleration concerns from the beginning of the year have gone.Taking a look at the PeP financials on Page 8, revenue grew plus 4.8% including the UK Mail acquisition.
Organically that was 1.9%.
And it's very pleasing to see how that has really translated into a 4% EBIT increase, driven by the normalized Mail volume decline, strong Parcel growth and also solid cost management.On the operating cash flow side, you're probably all aware that PeP is the division where the pension funding had the most distorting effect in 2016, so we have to adjust on the PeP side by EUR 955 million.
When we do that, we see that cash flow is actually slightly down and that is mainly due to working capital development in the second quarter.Yes, that takes me to Page 9 and Express, and Express had a very, very strong quarter.
The yellow machine is running smoothly.
And you can see that on Page 9 shipment per day growth was 8.5%; revenue per day growth was even stronger, 12.7%.
That was partially due to higher fuel surcharges, but we also see the benefits of disciplined yield management.In terms of geographies, the 2 big regions Europe and America grew very solidly with 11.6% and 10.8%.
Asia-Pacific, you will recall from the previous quarters that we are going through a yield exercise which we started last summer, so we still see the effect of 3.2% reduced growth.
But that's really a conscious decision, and from the summer onwards now we will see that fading out.So very strong development on the top line and that was of course the basis to then deliver a strong operating performance.
When you look at Page 10, you can see that EBIT for the quarter rose to EUR 469 million, up 12.2%, with a record margin now of 12.5%, and also very good performance on the operating cash flow side.CapEx, Express is one of the reasons why CapEx is a little bit behind in terms of phasing.
That really has to do with some of the big hub extensions which are going on in Express at the moment where it's more of a timing and phasing question.That brings us to Page 11 and Global Forwarding, Freight.
And what we see here is a continuation of what we had already discussed in May.
We continue to see strong growth both on the Air and on the Ocean Freight side.
You can see that on the left side of the page, Air Freight volumes up 11.4%, Ocean Freight up 6.6%.
But freight rates are at a high level and we are still working on passing on the increased freight rates to our customers, so the margin squeeze on the gross profit side continues.
And that is what you then see in the right part, Air Freight gross profit was down 10.6%, Ocean Freight gross profit down 5.6%.And clearly whilst that came in line with expectation for the second quarter, that is not a number we are pleased with.
We are taking a close look at implementing the measures to make sure that the good volume trend will translate also into a good gross profit and ultimately EBIT development in the second half of the year.And that takes us to Page 12 on the Global Forwarding, Freight financials.
Yes, I think we have already talked about the relevant drivers.
You can see the outcome now here in the numbers.
Revenue was up 5.5%, gross profit down minus 4.2%, EBIT slightly below last year.
And on the operating cash flow side, we also saw a negative development because particularly on the Forwarding side we had quite a bit of working capital buildup.
And CapEx, as you all know, is relatively a minor number for the Global Forwarding, Freight division.Yes, and that takes us last but not least to Supply Chain on Page 13.
In terms of order intake, there's a very clear focus on making sure that we get profitable business in, and despite this more selective approach, we are well on track to again achieve for the full-year a number of EUR 1 billion and more.And I think one other interesting thing to mention in Supply Chain is the speed with which new technologies are really being tested together with our customers in many of our operations.
We started using drones for inventory stock taking.
We are using robots in our warehouses to transport fixed materials.
We are using vision picking.
So there's really also a lot of technology exploitation going on in the Supply Chain division.And that is all part of the Supply Chain operational excellence agenda and the operational excellence agenda is paying off in the financials and that is what you can see on Page 14.
EBIT growth at face value was 21.6%.
If you take out the EUR 16 million restructuring spend in the second quarter of 2016, we had an increase of 5.1%.
I think both on the EBIT and also on the top line we should mention that we are seeing some adverse currency effects.
So when you look at the revenue number of minus 0.7%, when you adjust that for currency, we actually had an organic growth of 1.9%.That takes us to Page 15, our guidance page, and there is actually no change to that page.
So we confirm our guidance both for 2017 and for 2020, absolutely no changes to the same page we showed you in May.To wrap it all up, both our second quarter and our year-to-date confirm our progress towards our financial and strategic targets.
We have a unique global footprint which allows us to leverage organic growth opportunities across the value chain, in particular serving the sustained e-commerce growth trends.And our EBIT performance demonstrates our operating leverage and the levers, we have to improve efficiency across divisions, and that's of course in line with our 2020 targets.
So I think we believe we have found in the second quarter a good balance between generating attractive short-term returns while at the same time investing into the long-term setup and future growth for the company.On Page 17, you can see the summary of our investment profile.
I will finish with that -- and I think it's time for your questions now.
Thank you very much for your attention.
(Operator Instructions) And the first caller is, Tobias Sittig from MainFirst Bank.
Four, if I may.
Firstly, UPS explicitly mentioned the TNT cyber attacks as a source of volume growth for them.
Can you feel the same?
Can you quantify how big those impacts of market share gains were in the quarter and what that did to your European volumes?
Secondly, Parcel prices when I calculate rightly is down 4.6%, which is a bit counterintuitive since you get the same day volumes of AmazonFresh, which should probably have a slightly higher yield.
Can you explain what's driving the price decline in Parcels here?
Thirdly, on the gross profit on gross margins in Forwarding, they're down quite sharply and can you elaborate on how much is sort of rising rates being still to be passed on and where do you see maybe a normalized GP per ton or GP per TEU of the business you're currently signing?
And lastly, Middle-East, Africa, volumes up 25% and revenue up 5%.
How does that fit together?
Probably you haven't lowered your prices by 20%, but what's in there to make that match?
So let me start with the cyber attack and what that means for our volumes.
So I mean, fortunately, we were able to bring sense the impact of the attack on us quite quickly.
We were also impacted in the Ukraine, but were able to really get that under control quite quickly.
What we have seen subsequently is that indeed because of the difficulties some others had and have we have seen an increase in volumes, particularly in Express Europe, that had a small effect on the second quarter numbers because quite frankly it was more starting towards the end of the quarter.
We are still in the middle of this volume surge at the moment and at the moment we are focusing very intensely on making sure that this extra volume is not leading to a deterioration in our service quality.
Because of course we cater in our network for growth, but especially in some of the neuro points in our European network like Leipzig we are really feeling the volumes.
So intense focus is on making sure that we can cope with that on a high quality level.
So we hope that it will give us a positive contribution.
But it's nothing we bank on as a permanent trend.
I think that would be premature at this point in time.
With regard to Parcels, yes, it is a number which jumps into your eyes immediately that on the back of 6% volume growth we only had 1% revenue growth.
Structurally that is something we saw already in the previous quarters.
We have done some cleaning up these customers, for example, in the 2-Mann-Handling business.
Yes, we have relatively high revenues associated with those customers and marginal volume counts.
So when we take them out, we lose a lot of revenue and not a lot of volume and that leads to this distorting effect.
When you look at the underlying path of pricing levels, they are overall stable.
So we don't see a yield deterioration the way you could calculate just by looking at the 1.3% versus the 6.3% in the numbers.
Then on Global Forwarding and the gross profit margin there, I mean you're absolutely right, the performance is not satisfying and I think it's actually a combination of both buying and selling side.
So on the buying side, we, yes, were caught to a certain degree by surprise by the speed with which the rates went up particularly on certain lanes and also by the level in which the rates now were in the second quarter.
We have taken action on this basis for the second half of the year.
So clearly the buying side is an important element.
And the second element is of course in our selling, where we are working with great focus on passing on the increased rates to our customers.
With some customers that's an easy short-term thing.
But there are also larger customers, where we have longer term contracts where it's more of a time consuming negotiation.
So I can't say that we are fully through yet.
But the clear expectation also from Tim Scharwath and the forwarding team is that we will see the benefit of this exercise in the second half of the year.
And the fourth question with regard to Middle-East and Express, yes, that was actually driven by a handful of customers in Saudi Arabia, which is partly third billing business.
So we are looking at this because it was quite a lot of volume, this profitability, which we have to take a closer look at.
So I wouldn't over interpret the growth for Middle-East on the Express side.
I think what you see for Europe and Americas is a more normal thing.
I hope that answers your question.
Next caller please.
The next caller is Andy Chu from Deutsche Bank.
Three questions from me please, if I could.
Just in terms of the CapEx, obviously you're looking therefore to potentially spend over EUR 1.4 billion of gross CapEx in the second half.
Just wondered -- you touched on the hubs, but where exactly is the CapEx going?
Is it into Cincinnati, into Leipzig getting done?
What if the rest of that -- some of that actually slips into 2018?
Secondly, staying on cash flow, could you just help us in terms of working capital expectations for the full-year?
Is it right to think of only a sort of a small triple-digit outflow for the full-year?
Obviously, you pointed to some quite strong volumes obviously within Freight, Forwarding that's given quite a big working capital outflow within DGF.
And then just coming back to freight rates in terms of expectations -- and maybe I missed this right at the end of your explanation, but when do you think you will actually see a positive GP per unit territory?
Yes, so on the CapEx side, maybe, first, some backward looking explanation on where has the main CapEx gone.
So on the PeP side, when you look at the first 6 months, it was again the biggest CapEx consumption on the German Parcel network site and we couldn't see that as a continued area of investment.
So nothing structural in terms of change there.
I think the biggest CapEx consumer in the second half of the year will be our Express division.
When you look here at where this CapEx goes so far, we actually had something like EUR 150 million CapEx year-to-dates which went into our air fleet -- actually, half of that into maintenance and half into the rejuvenation of aviation fleet.
That will continue.
But actually the big driver also for the second half of the year will be the continued build-out of our hub infrastructure.
We still have some projects going on like the completion of the hub in Brussels.
We are extending in Cincinnati.
But we also have things like our ground hub in Mexico, our biggest service center in Singapore.
So it's really a lot of investment also in the ground infrastructure to quite frankly cope with the good volume growth we're seeing.
Yes, so biggest CapEx pool in the second half of the year will be from Express.
This is a well known area of spending.
With regard to working capital, I mean we said in our longer term outlook that this is a growing business.
We do expect that there will be some cash-out from working capital.
On that basis, we are actually quite pleased with our first half year performance.
We will fight very hard to keep the increase under control.
When you really look at our DSO and DPO performance, we are on a very good basis, so I think DSO and DPO it won't be that easy to optimize further.
And we also some interesting strengths, maybe just as a side remark, for example, on the Ocean Freight side.
And you all know about the capacity constraints on some of the routes, which has led also to some of the ocean carriers being much stricter with payment terms.
So they also use on certain routes the advantage of the high demand to say, "If you want to get onboard, you better pay on time." So we keep a close eye on it.
But with the growth of the business, it will be more of a small cash-out from working capital for the full-year.
That's our current expectation.
And finally, on the gross profit per unit for Global Forwarding, when do we expect this to turn into positive territory.
I mean, very clearly our expectation and my expectation is that in the second half of the year we will be able to turn the good volume development also into a good gross profit development and should see that really flow through to a year-over-year increase in EBIT.
That's the very clear expectation.
Next caller please.
Next up is Daniel RÃ¶ska from Sanford Bernstein.
Three questions, if I may.
First one on the e-commerce growth throughout Europe, where we're seeing revenue increase, but the EBIT for the Parcel in Europe isn't really taking off and I just wanted to ask you if you could provide some comments around the maturity curve and how you would expect EBIT margins throughout Europe to shape up in the long run, possibly in comparison to the German market?
How would you think about kind of the maturity curve of the different markets you are launching throughout Europe?
Second question also on DGF, but maybe more in terms of specialty logistics within DGF.
I think you commented before that the main improvements will be in DGF around volume, efficiency and then also more Specialized Freight.
Could you give us some more color around how you would envision that to play out in terms of what's the current percentage of revenue or tonnage in specialty logistics, how would that develop over time and drive margins in the business?
And lastly, probably a short update on UK Mail integration timeline, plan changes, how is that work progressing, any color you could provide would be helpful?
Okay, let me start with the Parcel Europe question, as you rightly say, we are seeing strong top line growth organically.
When you take out the UK Mail effect and currency effect, we're talking about a 21% of revenue increase and on the e-commerce side outside Germany 15%.
What we show you in terms of EBIT is the combined number for Parcel Europe and also for the rest of the world.
You also see the impact there of some of the new startup operations outside Europe, just for completeness.
In terms of maturity, I mean not surprisingly given the way we are building our European Parcel network, we are at different maturity levels.
I mean, we had some countries where we integrated existing profitable businesses from within the group and we also have countries where we are really in a startup phase.
So it is in terms of maturity a bit of a mixed bag.
And we really look at it also from a portfolio perspective, where we see that the whole portfolio is moving in the right direction.
In terms of profitability, yes, now this quarter it's minus 5% for the whole PeP operations outside Germany and I think that's in line with our guidance that it will be hoovering around the 0 line for this year as we are in the startup phase.
So I'm really not concerned about the minus 5%.
Maybe adding to that, your third question, because I think context wise it fits here, UK Mail, we are very satisfied with the progress on the UK Mail integration.
We are now beginning to use UK Mail as the delivery network for some of our cross-border streams coming from Europe into the UK.
That was always one of the big synergies we were expecting from the acquisition that we can use the UK Mail network as our delivery arm.
At the same time, we are now beginning to cross-sell our pan-European capabilities to the UK Mail customers.
So that is all going according to plan.
Then with regard to Global Forwarding and the Specialized Freight business, I assume that is relating to the others line, which you can also see in our statbook.
I think one important element here which was not doing so well over the last 2 years and is now really coming back is Industrial Project business.
That is quite dependent on the oil and gas industry and hence the last 2 years weren't the easiest.
But that is now really nicely coming back with some good new projects and also some of the existing customers recovering.
Maybe to clarify on the first one, do you have a target level for the EBIT of the European Parcel network in mind where you'd like to see the individual portfolio of countries kind of to go to in the long-term?
Is that around the German level, below, significantly different or different for each geography?
Yes, I mean it is quite different in terms of setup from the operations in Germany.
So, for example, when you look at our German PeP operation, we do pretty much all the delivery with our own workforce, a completely different approach outside Germany.
Because of the high labor cost in Germany, we are automating to a very high degree here in Germany with our parcel sorting centers and also further down towards the last mile.
In a different country where we have lower labor cost where we use subcontractors, the approach is a different one.
So even in terms of comparing target profitability, it's not as simple as looking at the EBIT margin because you really have to look at how much capital are we injecting into each of the countries and what are then the return expectations.
And there very clearly we have an idea where we want to go, but that is something which we also very clearly review to make sure we always find the right balance between growth and profitability.
For any further reference, Daniel, you may want to take a look also at the material and the transcript that we have on our half time report event done in Mail -- done in May, where we also covered that a bit.
Okay?
Thanks, Martin.
I know.
Thank you.
Any further questions, say, on Q2?
The next caller is Neil Glynn from Credit Suisse.
If I could ask 3 quick ones please.
We dealt with -- certainly, Melanie, I remember your comments with respect to APAC volume management in Express around the first quarter.
I'm just interested -- clearly, we've had the same dynamic I guess into the second quarter and I think that's the end of a 4 quarter cycle.
But it's come at the same time as you've seen considerably higher growth rates in all of the regions and I'm just interested, is that a coincidence or is that a deliberate strategy to compensate for the management of those APAC volumes?
Then a second question again on Express following on from an earlier question on free cash flow.
You mentioned obviously the spend in the first half of the year.
But if I look to free cash flow to EBIT conversion in the first half, it has been the highest in the last few years.
And I'm just interested in terms of can you -- do you have confidence that as we get into 2018 we might start to see a structurally higher level of free cash flow conversion given the fact that the EBIT margin certainly continues to expand?
And then a final question following on from the last question.
You touched on leveraging UK Mail to cross-sell into your pan-European capabilities within the Parcel business.
Just interested -- can you give us some flavor?
I assume your key USP there was quality, but as to how price competitive are you needing to be to win market share in the U.K. market?
Yes, so starting with your first question on the APAC volumes, what we see there is the result of a conscious decision, which is really linked to a specific situation also outbound from Asia.
Their flying capacity is quite constrained and so we had a number of planes -- or our planes out of Asia quite full and we took the conscious decision that before adding additional flights we want to go for the optimum on the yield side.
So we managed out some lower yielding business.
I mean, that's a continuous process we do all the time in the network.
But from a airline capacity perspective, it made particularly sense from Asia and that has led to those reduced volumes that we have now seen for the last 3 quarters, where we expect things to get more normal in terms of growth rates in the second half of the year.
In terms of will we see structurally higher free cash flow margins from Express, when we said for Express that this year is going to be the peak year on the CapEx side, but it will stay at a high level, that of course always depends on the volume, where at the moment we are on the upper end of what we had assumed for the volume growth.
So I think it will develop in the right direction, but that will also always be a balancing decision on making sure we get the optimal returns on our investments.
And I think what we see from the Express economics again in first 6 months of this year, the equation is working particularly well for the Express division.
And that takes me to your leverage UK Mail question, I mean the nice thing is -- UK Mail was more of a small player in the U.K.
Market, which we consciously chose also because of the quality of service.
We just feel that this is more compatible with our overall network approach.
Their service quality plays an important role.
We all know that the U.K. market is very competitive, so pricing is a topic.
But it's generally not our strategy to buy market shares at stupid prices.
And the next caller please.
The next caller is Damian Brewer from the Royal Bank of Canada.
Three questions please, two on DHL and one on PeP.
First, on DHL, could you elaborate a little bit more on what happened with the headcount productivity?
I mean, it just looks like the volume per employee was up nearly 5% in Q2, whereas historically you run at about 2% productivity on employees.
Has there been any significant change there, and if so, can you elaborate on what was it?
Secondly, I noticed that Cathay Pacific put out a press release saying you had sold out your stake in Air Honk Kong or were planning to do so.
Could you say a little bit more about how you're thinking about capital allocation and like capacity ownership or rental in your Express business particularly on the aircraft side and whether that has any implications in your stakes in AeroLogic or anywhere else within your aviation side of the Express business?
And then finally on PeP, can you remind us how long the current labor agreement run to?
And obviously the positive side of inflation is the rise in bond yields that have helped you in your pension liability, but can you tell us a little bit more about the issues and parameters you will think of as you position into the next labor negotiation?
So maybe I'll start backwards in terms of labor agreement.
So the current labor agreement for Deutsche Post AG runs until January 2018.
We have in other increase of 1.7%, which will come in on the 1st of October.
So for the next month we have planning clarity and then we will have the negotiation for our main entity Deutsche Post AG in January 2018.
With regard to the deliveries, our subsidiaries where we hire the new Parcel people, these are collective agreements for the logistics industry for different areas in Germany and there we have ongoing negotiations, one region after the other is coming up.
For I think this year, we have already concluded negotiations for I think at least 3 of those areas.
So that is more of an ongoing process.
But our big internal negotiation will be in January of 2018.
With regard to Cathay Pacific, I mean this joint venture construction was a historical construction, where the contract was now coming to a point where we had to take a view on what is the best way to continue our very, very good working relationship with Cathay.
So we will continue to use Cathay as a partner.
We have a new long-term agreement with them concluded.
It's just a more efficient way for us to structure the relationship going forward because the new setup will be a more standard setup which gives us higher operational flexibility.
That was a important element for us.
Aviation constructions are always special because of the legal restrictions in terms of foreign ownership and flying rights, so there's not a one-size-fits-all approach.
It really depends on the geography.
AeroLogic is of course an easier situation because it's a German entity with a German partner, for us is a German company, and the whole legal situation is much more straightforward than in the case of Hong Kong.
And I think we have now simply chosen a more straightforward and more simple setup.
And then in terms of the headcount productivity, I assume you were referring to DGF, yes?
No, to Express.
To Express, okay -- because you said DHL and I just wasn't sure.
So I think on Express, there is nothing extraordinary.
I mean, I have to say it was so unspectacular that I haven't looked at the numbers over the last 2 weeks.
But from what I recall from my last review, productivity is good.
The 2 important KPIs we always look at for the operational performance in Express, on the one hand side, our cost per kilo for aviation network, where we're actually making good year-over-year progress; and the second important KPI is something which we call ops cost per move, and there we see the impact from the investment in the infrastructure, so it's a little bit up year-over-year, but in line with what we had planned.
So I have not seen anything which concerned me in the Express operational KPIs.
Did I misunderstand your questions?
No, no, no.
I was just noting the employees are up 4% on 8.5% TDI growth.
But thank you, you've answered the question.
Well, thanks for bringing it up.
And, yes, next question please.
Next up is Edward Stanford from HSBC.
Just 2 questions on Forwarding, if I may.
It looks as if you have been growing a little bit faster than the market depending on how you measure it and your gross profit per unit has, as you said, come under a bit of pressure.
Is there a relationship with that?
Can some of that be rectified by being a little bit more choosy on the volumes that you take and are you prepared to do that?
And secondly, just on the working capital, it does seem to be a bit of a problem across the Forwarding sector at the moment.
Is this a step change in the industry or do you think you can squeeze some working capital in the second half?
Yes, so both very good questions.
The first one is ultimately about finding the right balance in this dynamic market between keeping good volume growth momentum, but making sure that it finds its way down to GP and EBIT.
So it is something where you can't give a generalistic answer.
It's something you really have to look in trade lane by trade lane and customer by customer, and that is what we are doing at the moment.
Tim Scharwath just spent the last week in Asia really doing in-depth reviews on the pricing on the different trade lanes, because, yes, you have to decide trade lane by trade lane, what is the right balance between volume growth and profitability.
Unfortunately, it's not a mathematical equation where you put in the parameters and then you get the one right answer.
It is to a certain degree more of a balancing art and it's at the core focus of our attention.
With regard to working capital -- and that's also an interesting question.
So we have worked quite hard especially on Forwarding on optimizing our working capital.
I mean, 3 years ago we still had pretty high numbers in terms of ageing receivables.
We have really managed that down a lot.
So I think for our the usual tricks of structurally improving things we have really worked very effectively.
I think the second thing that I mentioned briefly with regard to Ocean Freight, we also see that, yes, some of the suppliers in the industry are using their power in the current supply constraint market to also put more focus on payment conditions than they did in the past.
I mean, clearly when you have a comparatively scarce resource, that is also a lever you can pull.
So there is currently I think a bit of a structural headwind on working capital in the Forwarding industry.
Okay, that -- I think that's answering that and the next caller please.
The next caller is David Kerstens from Jefferies.
Two questions please, first on Parcel Europe.
You highlighted the 21% growth excluding the UK Mail acquisition effect.
That seems faster than some of the incumbent operators have published.
I was wondering if that's a truly organic number or does it still benefit from the expansion in new markets last year and which were the most important ones that still contributed to the 21% in the first half of the year?
Then secondly, on DHL Forwarding and Freight, you now derive about a 1/3rd of your profit from the Freight business, the Road Freight business, which doubled EBIT in the first half of the year on a stable gross profit.
I was wondering what's driving the improvement in the EBIT, gross profit conservation ratio and if this is now a sustainable profitability level for your Road Freight business going forward?
Yes, so maybe to the first question, what we took out for this organic growth number on the 21% were first of all the I think EUR 127 million in extra revenue we got from UK Mail and we also corrected for currency effects.
So the growth we got from the new businesses that we are building up is included in the organic number and naturally that is the main growth driver here and that is also what we were expecting and what we need to overtime get the return on our investment.
So I would be concerned if we would grow only at the pace of the incumbents.
So that is, yes, what you would expect in a business which is in a build up phase.
Yes, on your Road Freight question, that is really a business which is doing very, very well.
And we have one effect here, which you can see in our second quarter number, which makes the gross profit to EBIT conversion look even better.
So we decided to restructure our UK domestic business in Freight, which was unlike the rest of our Freight business, relatively asset intense.
So on this relatively asset intense business, we needed a higher gross profit margin and that is why actually the gross profit came down a little bit in the second quarter when you look at the Freight numbers.
That's the one distorting element there.
I think overall we are really moving in the right direction with the Freight business.
We have a new CEO who has been managing this part of the business since the 1st of January, who has great aspirations where he wants to take it for the rest of the year.
So that's, I believe is in terms of Forwarding freight, a nice topic to look at.
The next caller then please.
The next caller is Dominic Edridge from UBS.
Just 2 questions from myself.
Firstly, in terms of obviously the Freight, Forwarding business, are you sort of happy that the systems you have in place there sort of give you an accurate reflection of profitability?
Are any of the issues around -- the numbers you're reporting in terms of profitability, are there anything to do with maybe the issues you've had with the systems in the past or are you happy that basically the systems are in place and the people are -- it's just a case of an industry-wide situation there?
And the second question more generally is, obviously it feels like many of your businesses are seeing very strong volume growth.
Obviously, you are adding capacity in.
In terms of any -- and where would you say the greatest limitations are for you at the moment in terms of the capacity?
And in the short run, is there anything out there that you would say could mean that the growth rates do slow down quite a bit from the point of view yourselves putting the breaks on?
Yes, on the first question if I understood it correctly, the DGF numbers and that they looked very, very (inaudible) is not due to some system topics.
I think that is really an accurate reflection of the current state of affairs.
I mean, as you know, we are working on our general IT upgrade for Global Forwarding and there will be also some advantages with regard to financial transparency and flexibility going forward.
So, for example, on flexibility of coming up with pricing decisions, the new systems will give us advantages.
But in terms of reporting accuracy, that is not going to change.
So the way the numbers look is not due to some system challenges.
With regard to capacity limitations, yes, I mean one of the things where you see that in action at the moment is what I mentioned earlier, our Express growth out of Asia.
It would have been very easy for us to show significantly higher volume growth rates out of Asia, but that would have meant that we would have to add additional airplanes, which is an expensive decision.
And we will add additional airplanes eventually.
But I think that is really one of the things where you have to look very carefully when is the right point in time, how long do you want to go for yield management?
That is now the approach we had taken, making sure that we first get the profitability up.
So this whole capacity management is more of a continuous process.
The area where I think you need the most forward thinking is with regard to the hub extension, yes.
I mean, if you have significant volume surges in some of your critical hubs, that is nothing where you can double capacity within 6 months.
So particularly on the hub side you need some planning ahead.
But here we are beginning to see the benefits of the extensions we have now been doing over the last years.
And then, sorry, just a follow-up on that last point in terms of -- obviously, you have spent quite a bit of money in the last few years.
Do you feel because of that and because obviously what you are doing going forward, there's no real big humps we should be expecting going forward in terms of you've got the network where you want it to be and you might â€“- and you will have to add continuously, but it's not like there is any sort of big step ups that we should be expecting over the next few years even if volume growth continues to surprise on the upside?
Yes.
I mean, what we have said is that this year will be the peak year for the Express CapEx, but that we expect it to then stay at a relatively high level.
So don't expect it to drop down because we are done with expanding.
So I don't think there's a risk that we move too much on the upside, but you also shouldn't expect that it's going to 1/2 in the next 2 years.
And the next caller please.
The next caller is David Ross from Stifel.
Just 25 questions, if I may please.
Yes, sure.
Joking.
Could you just talk about the current air freight environment through July and into August here?
We've seen a lot of strength; it started about a year ago.
So do you think we are just getting to the point of more difficult comps and it should slowdown or is there something you're seeing in the air freight market where you expect strong growth to continue well into next year?
Well, that was only one question instead of 25.
Okay.
So I think my answer to that would be, at the moment we don't have any reason to believe that the volume development slows down.
I also I mean saw some clippings yesterday that some people say it's not as buoyant as it was in the first 6 months.
That's not what we are seeing.
So at the moment, also from the discussions with our customers, we don't see a slowdown.
So we expect the dynamic to continue now for the third quarter for sure.
And to be clear, you don't see a slowdown in the growth rates or in the absolute volume of air freight tonnage?
Yes, I mean in the -- I would say that in the fourth quarter we will see a bit of a effect from the strong -- especially towards the end of the year a [stronging] up fourth quarter.
But, no, really at this point in time we don't see a slowdown in the growth rates.
I'm not guaranteeing that that won't happen in the fourth quarter, but really based on what we see at the moment, the dynamic continues.
And then, lastly, on the Ocean side of things, are you seeing any different patterns there?
Is Ocean not as strong, strengthening, weakening?
Yes, I think Ocean was really one of the surprises in the first half of the year, where we also saw all of a sudden volume surges and capacity constraints on lanes where I think nobody had seen that in this way before like on some of the Europe to Asia trade lanes.
I would say on that, it's not -- it is normalizing a bit, so it's not on the same tightness level which we have seen to a certain degree unexpectedly in the first half of the year.
But the market is also not cooling off in a dramatic way.
And we are doing reasonably well on time, but I think we have got time for 2 or 3 further questions.
Operator?
The next caller is Andre Mulder from Kepler.
I have 2 questions, first one on the international EBIT in PeP.
In Q1 you saw a tripling of that number with the help of, for example, UK Mail.
That will also have played a role in the second quarter, but there we saw a reversal.
Can you comment on that?
Second question is, I noticed a sort of hiccup in depreciation in Express in Q2.
Can you comment on that?
What was happening there?
There's seems to be an additional EUR 30 million or so.
And to what extent has that hurt the performance of Express in Q2?
Yes, so on the first question, the international EBIT, I mean for me that it's in line with our guidance that it will be hovering around the 0 line.
It may be up 10, it may be down 10.
I think that really depends a little bit on the phasing of some of our build out activities, which on the international part and e-commerce side are predominantly OpEx driven.
So it really has to with timing of certain start up activities both in parts of Europe, but also in the operations outside Europe.
So I wouldn't over interpret a single quarter on that number.
With regard to the Express line in depreciation, yes, well spotted, that's absolutely correct.
But it's nothing to worry about.
In this second quarter we had a positive development on one of our very old U.S. reseller cases, which gave us an EBIT upside, and in line with our aviation re-fleeting plan, we accelerated the depreciation on some older aircrafts.
Both elements together had a 0 impact on the EBIT and a 0 impact on the cash, which is why we didn't mention it proactively because it's not distorting the numbers at all neither on the EBIT, nor on the cash side.
That's the background to that.
And a follow-up question on your first answer.
You said it will be hovering around 0.
Can you give us any indication of how long that will be hovering around 0, should we expect the next 2 or 3 quarters or longer?
Yes, I mean we [cap] it also in the context of our Strategy 2020 halftime report.
I mean, clearly when you look at where our PeP EBIT is coming from at the moment, it's Germany, and that is also the basis for our 2020 guidance that we want to grow on this on average 3%.
We don't expect a massive contribution from our Parcel Europe and e-commerce activities.
So this â€“- around the 0 line trend will continue for some quarters.
And then quite frankly, it will depend also on the success of all these activities, how we take it forward.
Because if -- I mean, we are launching some early stage e-commerce operations, for example, in Thailand, we have now launched in Vietnam.
If those things go extremely well, that may also be a motivation to accelerate the investment.
So very clearly for this year and the upcoming quarters the profitability development in PeP will be driven by the German development.
All right, then the next caller please.
The next caller is Christian Obst from Baader Bank.
Just one question.
We currently have the situation that the bankruptcy of Hanjin, some GDP growth and the more discipline in the entire liner business is pushing up freight rates.
And then it comes to the freight forwarders and the express business and there is also -- there is capacity restraints and more discipline and you can also push some thing going up to the customers.
How is the reaction of customers you are currently sorting out?
Is there any risk that you are getting squeezed going forward, if customers are regaining some bargaining power going forward maybe in the next half year or in 2 years whatsoever?
Or do you really think that there is some structural change that not only the liners can push through rising freight rates because of discipline, but also the entire structure of express and forwarders can also push through their intention of higher profitability?
I think to a certain degree -- I mean, especially when you look at Ocean rate, what we see is part of the normal forwarding cycle, where in times of raising rates you always have a delay as a broker between the increase in your buying rates and passing it on to the customers.
And I think that is something where, yes, the forwarding business is used to and you now have to kind of like work that through.
Ultimately, I think on the Ocean freight side, we had pricing levels which were not healthy.
I think I said that on one of the previous occasions.
I mean, when it's cheaper to transport a container from Asia to the U.S. than to do the hinterland transport within the U.S., I think something is wrong with the pricing.
And we were at those levels.
So I think it is especially on the Ocean freight side more of a normalization, where we now have to work through our pricing to the customer.
I think the dynamic on the Air freight side have been more volatile.
I think rates haven't been as low as on the Ocean freight side.
But now really the dynamic in the first month of the year were also very peculiar.
I think that takes a bit more of a convincing to sell it to the customers.
But I think here ultimately the customers will be very interested that their stuff gets transported in good quality and that is I think the ultimate discussion.
Yes, if the rates don't work you can't service that customer anymore.
I normally hope that it doesn't get to that point, but those are, yes, the difficult pricing discussions our sales people are currently going through.
Have you lost some important customers in that entire process or some bigger customers not only in the Express business, but also in the Parcel business which you sorted out not coming back and taking as their forwarders or express company.
So what is the amount?
Has it increased in a meaningful amount or by a meaningful amount in the next -- in the last 12 months?
So I would say -- I mean, on the Express side, clearly no.
And that was really mainly kind of like areas where we were not satisfied with pricing levels and worked in it from our end.
I think the global forwarding market, the willingness to change is traditionally higher than in some of the other businesses.
And there we have lost customers, also bigger customers, but we have also regained and won customers.
So I think it may be a bit more dynamic than what it has been historically, but that is also really part of the Forwarding business.
And, Operator, any further callers out there?
No, there are no further callers.
Great.
All right.
Well, I think that concludes our Q&A round and our Q2 2017 call.
