Hello, everyone.
Thank you for joining us today.
I am Tetsuya Otake.
It's my pleasure to discuss Toyota's financial results for the first quarter for the fiscal year ending March 2018.
Let me start with Slide 5.
Compared to the first quarter of the previous fiscal year, consolidated vehicle sales increased by 43,000 units to 2,215,000 units.
This was a result of strong sales in Japan, North America and New York, driven by new models.
Please look at Slide 6.
Consolidated financial results for the first quarter were: net revenues of JPY 7,047,600,000,000; operating income of JPY 574.2 billion; pretax income of JPY 679.3 billion; and a net income of JPY 613.5 billion.
Using Slide 7, I'd like to explain the factors which impacted operating income year-on-year.
Despite the positive effects of cost-reduction efforts, operating income was down JPY 67.9 billion, mainly due to the effects of marketing activities and an increase in expenses.
Excluding the overall impact of foreign exchange rates and swap valuation gains and losses, operating income fell by JPY 25 billion.
Next, I'd like to break down operating income by region.
Please see Slide 8.
In Japan, vehicle sales increased by 33,000 units year-on-year to 544 units, driven by new models such as the Roomy, Tank and the C-HR.
Operating income increased by JPY 29.7 billion to JPY 319.9 billion, mainly due to the vehicle sales growth and the cost reduction efforts.
Please look at Slide 9.
In North America, vehicle sales 8,000 unit to 723,000 year-on-year.
Operating income was JPY 88.8 billion, down JPY 76.5 billion compared to the first quarter of the previous fiscal year.
This was largely a result of marketing expenses.
Also, we have increased marketing expenses in response to the current market and sales environment.
We intend to control them adequately, following the launch of the new Camry.
The new Camry, which is being rolled out in the States this summer, in the first model with all-new TNVA platform and powertrains.
It delivered significantly improved driving, safety and a fuel efficiency performance in addition to an attractive decline.
We hope many more customers will enjoy the new Camry.
In Europe, on Slide 10.
Vehicle sales grew by 18,000 units year-on-year to 240,000 units on the back of solid sales of the brand-new C-HR.
Operating income was up JPY 11.9 billion to JPY 20.5 billion.
This was mainly a result of increased vehicle sales and cost-reduction efforts.
Please look at Slide 11.
In Asia, vehicle sales were down 21,000 units year-on-year to 363,000 units.
Operating income decreased by JPY 21.7 billion to JPY 102.8 billion, largely due to the effect of ForEx rates and the decreased vehicle sales.
Please move on to Slide 12.
In other regions, overall vehicle sales for the first quarter were 345,000 units, up 5,000 units year-on-year, driven by Central and South America and Oceania.
Operating income increased by JPY 11.3 billion to JPY 39.5 billion, mainly due to the impact of ForEx rates and vehicle sales growth.
Next, please look at Slide 13 on financial services.
Operating income, excluding swap valuation gains and losses for the first quarter declined JPY 6.4 billion year-on-year to JPY 75.1 billion.
Also, the lending balance grew.
There was an increase in costs related to loan losses and remarketing of returned leased vehicles.
On Slide 14, equity in earnings of affiliated companies for the first quarter increased by JPY 47.8 billion year-on-year to JPY 137.8 billion.
This was primarily a result of solid performance of our affiliated companies in Japan.
Now please look at Slide 15 on liquid assets.
At the end of June, net liquid assets reached JPY 7,872,800,000,000.
We remain committed to investment in R&D and CapEx and shareholders return.
In addition, we have the necessity to consider all options, including M&A, as a means to carve out our future.
Now I'd like to move on to discuss the outlook for the full fiscal year ending March 2018.
Please look at Slide 17.
We maintain our initial forecast for the consolidated vehicle sales at 8.9 billion units.
By region, vehicle sales are revised up in Japan and Europe and down in North America and Asia.
Please look at Slide 18.
From July, we adapt ForEx rate assumptions of JPY 110 per dollar and JPY 125 per euro, making the full year assumption JPY 110 per dollar and JPY 124 per euro.
Based on this, our forecast for consolidated financial performance are: net of revenues of JPY 28,500,000,000,000; operating income of JPY 1,850,000,000,000; pretax income of JPY 2,050,000,000,000; and net income of JPY 1,750,000,000,000.
Please look at Slide 19.
Our latest forecast for operating income is now JPY 1,850,000,000,000, up JPY 250 billion from our initial forecast.
This is due to the weaker yen assumption and additional effects of marketing activities and cost-reduction efforts that we have identified and factored in.
Next, please see Slide 20 for the year-on-year comparison of operating income.
Excluding the impact of the foreign exchange rates and swap valuation gains and losses, our operating income is still expected to decrease by JPY 270 billion.
However, we will strive to minimize this by all possible means.
Please look at Slide 21, which summarized our discussion.
To avoid 2 consecutive years on earnings decline, we remain determined to implement further profit improvement measures.
Please turn to Slide 22.
At the same time, as communicated by Akio Toyoda, our President, at the year-end financial announcement in May and at the AGM in June, we are committed to enhancing our competitiveness this fiscal year.
Our plan is to actively engage, in offense, to read the competition in the future; defense, that the forecast is on the immediate business change and the work innovation that is not constrained by the way of the past.
In this way, we will continue to strengthen our mid- to long-term competitiveness while accelerating earnings improvement for this fiscal year.
This concludes my presentation.
Thank you very much for your attention.
