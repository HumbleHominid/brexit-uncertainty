Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for taking trouble out of your occupied schedules and braving this inclemental weather.
Thank you very much for joining us.
We would like to start the first part of fiscal year 2018 financial results presentation.
Let me, first of all, introduce the members present for the first part.
Koji Kobayashi, Executive Vice President.
Good afternoon, everyone.
Masayoshi Shirayanagi, Senior Managing Officer.
Very nice to meet you all.
First of all, Shirayanagi will present to you the overview of financial results; then after that, we would open the floor for discussion.
The presentation materials at the very outset gives you the cautionary notes with respect to the forward-looking statements, and please go through that at least once.
So without further ado, I would like to have Shirayanagi present the financial results.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
I am Masayoshi Shirayanagi.
Thank you very much for joining us today for this financial results presentation.
It is my pleasure to discuss to you this financial results for the fiscal year, which ended in March 2018.
Compared to the previous fiscal year, consolidated vehicle sales decreased by 7,000 units to 8,964,000 units.
However, retail vehicle sales, shown on the bottom of the slide, increased by 190,000 units year-on-year.
The difference between consolidated and retail vehicle sales is mainly due to the inclusion of increased sales of Chinese joint venture affiliates in retail vehicle sales.
Consolidated financial results for the fiscal year were net revenue of JPY 29,379.5 billion, operating income of JPY 2,399.8 billion, pretax income of JPY 2,620.4 billion and net income of JPY 2,493.9 billion.
Please note that net income includes the positive impact of about JPY 250 billion due to the U.S. tax reform.
This is due mainly to the unwinding of deferred tax liabilities as a result of the reduction in the corporate tax rate concerning the accelerated depreciation of leased vehicles in our finance subsidiaries.
Operating income increased by JPY 405.4 billion compared to the previous fiscal year, as you see on the slide.
I would like to explain the factors which impacted operating income year-on-year.
First, the positive effect of foreign exchange rates was JPY 265 billion.
Please find the breakdown in footnote 1 in the bottom left corner of the slide.
There was a JPY 215 billion of positive transactional impact of foreign exchange rates mainly resulting from a JPY 3 depreciation against the dollar and an JPY 11 depreciation against the euro.
In addition, the translational impact of foreign exchange rates on the operating income of overseas subsidiaries resulted in a JPY 25 billion increase in operating income.
The impact on the fiscal year and balance of provisions in foreign currencies resulted in an additional JPY 25 billion operating income increase.
Secondly, the cost-reduction efforts increased operating income by JPY 165 billion as the impact of cost-reduction efforts exceeded the increase in raw materials costs.
Thirdly, with respect to marketing activities, a large increase in sales incentives in North America decreased operating income by JPY 100 billion.
Finally, expenses and other factors increased operating income by JPY 60 billion due to the decrease in costs, such as product quality-related expenses.
For your information, excluding the overall impact of foreign exchange rates, swap valuation gains and losses and other factors, operating income improved by JPY 125 billion year-on-year.
Compared to the previous forecast, the time we announced our third quarter results, operating income represents an improvement of JPY 180 billion.
Now I'd like to elaborate on operating income for each region from the left-hand side to the right-hand side of the slide.
In Japan, vehicle sales decreased by 19,000 units year-on-year to 2,255,000 units due to the decreased vehicle sales of the previous (inaudible).
Operating income was up JPY 455.7 billion year-on-year to JPY 1,661.8 billion due to cost-reduction efforts during model switch-overs and marketing efforts as well as the effect of foreign exchange rates.
In North America, vehicle sales were down 31,000 units year-on-year to 2,806,000 units.
The negative impact of decreased passenger vehicle sales, such as that of the Corolla, exceeded the positive impact of increased SUV sales, such as the RAV4.
Operating income was JPY 132.1 billion, down JPY 198.7 billion compared to the previous fiscal year.
This was largely a result of a temporary decline in local vehicle production related to the Camry switch-over, where production was supported by Japan, combined with increased sales incentives.
Sales incentives were mainly devoted to reducing the increase in installment and lease payments on the back of rising interest rates.
In Europe, vehicle sales grew by 43,000 units year-on-year to 968,000 units, driven by the C-HR and hybrid vehicle models.
Operating income was up JPY 88.9 billion year-on-year to JPY 77.1 billion.
This was mainly a result of cost-reduction efforts and a decrease in expenses.
In Asia, vehicle sales were down 45,000 units year-on-year to 1,543,000 units.
Operating income, however, was up JPY 4.3 billion year-on-year to JPY 428.8 billion as a result of solid sales in China and cost-reduction efforts.
In other regions, overall, vehicle sales were up 45,000 units year-on-year to 1,392,000 units on the back of solid sales, driven by the sales of Hilux and Etios in Central and South America.
Operating income increased by JPY 54.7 billion year-on-year to JPY 118.1 billion.
This was primarily due to marketing efforts, including increased vehicle sales, and the effect of foreign exchange rates.
Next, please see this slide for the operating income of financial services.
Operating income, excluding some valuation gains and losses for the fiscal year, was up JPY 43.4 billion year-on-year to JPY 283.9 billion.
This was mainly due to an increase in lending balance, a decrease in expenses related to loan losses and decrease in the costs related to residual value losses in the U.S. lease businesses.
Next, please look at this slide on shareholder return.
With regards to the year-on-year dividend on shares of common stock, we plan to make it JPY 120 per share; thus, the dividend on shares of common stock for the fiscal year will be JPY 220 per share, including the interim dividend of JPY 100 per share.
This represent an increase by JPY 10 per share compared to the previous fiscal year as a result of payout ratio for the fiscal year will be 26.1%.
We will continue to pay dividends stably and sustainably regardless of fluctuations in earnings using the consolidated payout ratio of 30% as a benchmark.
For your reference, excluding the temporary increase in net income due to the U.S. tax reform, the payout ratio for the fiscal year would be 29%.
This summarizes our shareholder return.
The total amount of dividends on both shares of common stock and Model AA class shares together with the fiscal year ended March 2018 will be JPY 650.1 billion.
We also plan to buy back up to JPY 300 billion or 55 million shares of common stock as the year-end shareholder return.
Since JPY 249.9 billion worth of shares of common stock were already repurchased as shareholder return for the first half of the fiscal year, the total share repurchase of the fiscal year which ended in March 2018 will be up to JPY 549.9 billion or 88 million shares.
As a result, together with year-end dividend to the total shareholder return for the fiscal year will be up to $1,200.1 billion, and the total return ratio will be a maximum of 48.1%.
For the reference, excluding the temporary increase of net income due to the U.S. tax reform, the total return ratio would be 53.4%.
Now I would like to move on to discuss the forecast to the current -- for the current fiscal year ending March 2019.
Consolidated vehicle sales are expected to be 8.95 million units, down 14,000 units year-on-year.
We anticipate that vehicle sales will increase in Asia, especially in Thailand, but decrease in Japan, where the new model impact will be diminishing, as well as in the Middle East.
We have assumed the foreign exchange rates to be JPY 105 per dollar and JPY 130 per euro.
We, thus, expect the yen to appreciate by JPY 6 to the dollar and remain unchanged to the euro year-on-year.
Based on this, our forecasts of consolidated financial performances are net revenue of JPY 29 trillion, operating income of JPY 2,300,000,000,000, pretax income of JPY 2,450,000,000,000 and net income of JPY 2,120,000,000,000.
So please see this slide.
We forecast JPY 99.8 billion decrease in operating income compared to the fiscal year, which ended in March 2018.
Major factors are as follows.
Firstly, the negative effect of ForEx rates, based on the assumption that the yen will appreciate to JPY 105 per dollar, will be JPY 230 billion.
Secondly, we anticipate that the cost-reduction efforts will have a positive impact on operating income of JPY 130 billion due to the ongoing cost-reduction activities despite the anticipated increase in raw material costs continuing from the previous fiscal year.
Thirdly, we estimate that the effects of marketing activities will be negative JPY 50 billion, mainly due to an expected increase in sales incentives for North America on the back of rising interest rates.
Finally, expenses are expected to have a positive impact of JPY 50 billion due to a decrease in product quality-related expenses and other factors.
As a consequence, excluding overall impact of ForEx rates and swap valuation gains and losses, operating income is expected to be up JPY 130 billion year-on-year.
In order to achieve further profit improvement, we will reinforce the Toyota production system and pursue cost-reduction efforts across the company.
Finally, we would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of our customers who chose us; as well as our dealers, suppliers and all of our other stakeholders for making these financial results possible.
We will further strengthen our profitability by further reducing costs and actively investing in future technologies.
In this way, we would like to achieve a transformation from automotive company to a mobility company.
We would appreciate your continued support and guidance.
This concludes my presentation on the financial results of the fiscal year that ended in March 2018.
Thank you.
Now ladies and gentlemen, we would like to entertain questions from the audience.
But before doing so, Kobayashi, Executive Vice President, is going to say a few words to you.
Well, thank you very much for joining us, and we are indeed delighted to have such a high level attendance by journalists.
And by receiving many feedback or input from you, through our serious efforts, we are trying to have Toyota and Toyota Motor Corporation fully understood in its essence, and that's why we hold those meetings.
But in the case of our full year financial result announcement, there tend to be the situation where trivial technical issues and major strategic issues are combined in discussion, and therefore, in the first part, we have decided to have those pure financial results-related presentation; in the second part, we are going to have Akio Toyoda explain to you his aspirations and the strategy that he's going to [pursue] going forward.
We primarily have journalists here today, but we also have investors and shareholders [and shareholders] because we would like to receive as many opinions as possible from as broadened spectrum of our stakeholders so that we can benefit in that and reflect that in Toyota's operations going forward.
And that reflects our President's aspirations.
Thank you very much.
So please raise your hand if you wish to ask a question for the microphone to be brought to you.
And I know that we have so many people in the audience, and we would like to receive questions from as many people in the audience as possible, so allow me to restrict 1 person to ask only 2 questions -- up to 2 questions.
So the first question first?
[Ando] of Jiji News Agency.
My question is addressed to Mr.
Kobayashi, EVP.
In terms of the financial results of the fiscal year just ended and also the forecast for the currently running fiscal year, I have questions each.
First of all, about the assessment of the actual results for fiscal year ending in March '18, when the financial result was announced in February, you said your assessment was across, and that is to say targets was not met.
But what is your assessment?
And moving on to the forecast for the fiscal year ending in March 2019, in terms of the sales revenue, for the fiscal year ending in March '18, you revised those guidance every quarter, and are you being quite conservative in coming up with this forecast for the fiscal year ending in March '19?
And with respect to North American business, in the forecast for the current fiscal year, the import restrictions or tariff on steel and aluminum or NAFTA [renegotiation] by Trump administration or in the eve of a midterm election, there seems to be some production (inaudible) tendencies in the trade area.
Has that been incorporated in your forecast?
Or what is your stance vis-à-vis such a policy of United States?
On the previous occasion when we made the financial result announcement for the third quarter on the entire fiscal year, excluding exchange rate fluctuations, we mentioned negative JPY 55 billion.
And that's why I said my evaluation is negative.
And that is reported quite negatively.
But our employees are working very hard and employees believing that the assessment came to them was negative is not really good in rewarding their efforts.
And I have been engaged in the field [in truck], and in terms of the high jump, we exceeded the hurdle, but still our volume is still being swayed or not really solid on the ground because, excluding exchange rate fluctuation impact, the figure is JPY 125 billion.
But there are various factors incorporated in those numbers.
Unless we can earn JPY 300 billion or JPY 400 billion, we simply cannot make up for any impact stemming from exchange rate fluctuations.
However, for the current fiscal year announcement, we now have a clear idea of the challenges we are facing.
That is to say, in terms of fixed expenses, we saw the increase there by JPY 240 billion, exceeding JPY 200 billion over a 5-year period.
And this is clear in the financial statements, fixed expenses increased by JPY 1 trillion over 5 years, with the sales volume not keeping pace with that.
So that's clearly the challenge for us.
Clarified.
And also with the higher interest rates in United States is, to a certain extent, offset by incentives.
So that's another negative factor.
In terms of cost-reduction efforts on the gross basis, we have been generating cost reduction in excess of JPY 300 billion.
That is not much different from the past years.
The President himself is emphasizing on TPS and cost reduction.
Those efforts were initiated since the beginning of this year, so we are only 3 months in.
Cost reduction is not that easy to be achieved.
And frankly speaking, even if we talk about cost reduction, cost does not come down immediately.
And when we talk about cost reduction, we're talking about gross cost of raw.
In the past, we're talking primarily about the manufacturing cost.
But what President constantly says that employees of Toyota Motor Corporation does have a clear mindset of overall cost involved.
That is to say the TPS involves the manner and also the cost.
People think that cost must be used very sparingly, and we need to restore that mindset.
And that's why it's taking time for the clear benefits of cost-reduction efforts to come up.
For the fiscal year just ended, we actually generated JPY 335 billion or so in cost savings.
We would like to achieve that.
And also, by different regions, we do have issues in North America at the moment.
So although we did make such good results in cost-reduction efforts, but now that we see the clear idea of where the challenges and problems are, by setting up a clearer plan, we are going to enhance our earnings power.
For the fiscal year ending in March 2019, since joining in January, I have been implementing changes.
And also, we have been revising those guidance every quarter.
That's not good.
But if we indicate too large the target, which will not be obtained, that may cause confusion amongst -- in the minds of our shareholders or stakeholders.
Of course, we have to be very conservative in coming up with the budgets, but being too conservative is not good, simply wanting to exceed that.
And therefore, it is conservative, but at the same time, it includes some element of aggressiveness as well, so included a higher target for cost reduction efforts.
And so this number you see in the forecast represents our hard work incorporated in that.
You're talking about North America, the NAFTA renegotiation, among others.
It has not been settled, and there is no clear outlook of that where it is going.
And therefore, what we need to do is [Mr.
Leroy], EVP [and head]; and with Mr.
Jim Lentz, North America CEO, working together, we are now trying and working very hard to reestablish the earnings power in North America earning structure.
We now have some clarity in terms of what need to be done by them.
What we are aiming at is to achieve 8% by 2020 because that represents the capability of our North American operations.
So we'll try to bring it back to 8% by 2020 for North America.
That's where we stand currently.
The person in the middle, please.
[Oshkiri] from Nihon Keizai Shimbun newspaper.
I have following question about the U.S. market outlook.
Well, because in the third quarter 2018 annual, the market forecast is like a 16.8 million; and the total, we'll try to aim at the same level as the previous year.
But recently, interest rates are increasing in the U.S. markets.
So what's again your latest outlook of the U.S. market?
And also, incentive problem -- incentive last year, the previous year that it pushed down this -- the income by JPY 140 billion, but to what extent this incentive will adversely affect Avalon?
And Avalon and RAV4 will be launched as new models.
How can you overcome this difficulty of incentive problem in the U.S. market?
That's the second question.
My third question is that the R&D costs this year, it's likely to increase as well, research cost.
But for the next year, 5% increase, 25% is for the next-generation advanced technology development within the R&D budget.
But this year, within the R&D, what is allocation or breakdown for the new technology -- generation technology to -- what's the percentage that you give?
And where -- which area of research you try to and increase your R&D budget?
Well, in terms of North America, the 16.8 million unit market size is still the same.
But in that sense, still, truck is increasing.
SUV and trucks are increasing as percentage.
But there could be maybe the delivery, the capacity increases are delayed, so we were a bit slow in supply.
But this year, we can catch up with that.
So we'd like to sell more of the saleable vehicles, attractive vehicles, to satisfy the demand of the U.S. customers.
Incentive issue, we -- as I mentioned earlier, is still the lease.
The residual value loss is another issue related to lease vehicles; especially in the used vehicle market, it's still stagnant so that the residual value loss is occurring still.
So that has an impact on the finance section -- financial services.
Interest rates are going up slightly in the U.S.
So the incentive of this year's level are likely to be continued.
But the way you give the incentive should be scrutinized more in a specific way.
It's not automatic giving out of the incentive, but rather, every month or every 3 months, by looking at the market trend, you have to give the incentive according to each model, subtype and so on.
So as -- based upon the study result, we'd like to cope with this incentive payout more carefully.
About R&D expenses and for the new area, about 3% is for this kind of a particular area; R&D percentage, 3%.
But still, in the new-generation businesses or the new technology development is something like 35% on the total.
So gradually, there's a shift to the new-generation technology, and we continue that trend or emphasizing the new technology connected and electrification and new areas and new mobility, society-related advance payment, investment is necessary in R&D.
So TPS and the cost reduction contributing to get the earning power of our company in order to secure the fund for this -- the new technology R&D.
May I invite the next question, please?
Yes, please, person on this side of the room.
[Shikano] of NHK.
My 2 -- I have 2 questions to Mr.
Kobayashi.
Question number one, which is somewhat related to the earlier question, in order to enhance earnings capability, you're focusing on TPS or cost reduction very extremely in import.
And President Akio also has been emphasizing that repeatedly.
But once again, what are the challenges we have today?
And what sort of initiatives and activities concretely are you implementing right now?
Could you share that with us?
And question number two, in terms of this financial results announcement, it starts at 1:30, and you have 2 parts.
This is a new method.
As we've mentioned earlier, once again, I would like you to explain the fact that you have somehow changed the way in which those press conferences are held since you became EVP.
So could you share with us the objective of having this method?
Well, this time, for this meeting, President Toyoda, all of a sudden, at the ceremony inviting new recruits, talked about the focus on TPS and cost reduction.
These are nothing new for Toyota.
However, are Toyota's employees, our colleagues, are fully aware of the importance of TPS and cost reduction?
Not necessarily.
The people working for Toyota, in terms of the mentality, a constitution must be, first of all, solidly held in their minds.
And that in itself should be cultivated by human resource development in the company because the company, after all, is the group of people.
And if individual employees are fully aware of the importance of TPS and cost reduction, having that in the mindset, so they'll realize the demand must be used very carefully and no waste should be allowed.
I'm sure you are working under the guidance of your bosses, and we are now in the process of creating the new plans.
In the manufacturing cost reduction, we are generating over JPY 300 billion in savings through cost-reduction efforts.
That's well established.
But what we see a problem still residing, it relates to the administrative and other professional areas.
That is to say the unnecessary meetings held or unnecessary time spent for -- around behind-the-scenes coordination, poor coordination and other wasteful activities.
We have in Toyota terminology called genchi genbutsu, regardless of the titles.
Let's discuss it out in the genba.
That's a good way to find solution.
However, unawares, we tend to simply go up the hierarchy to obtain the authorization.
That takes time.
And also, although it is not necessary the information materials are prepared, even if [nobody raise it] and these have been identified as wasteful efforts, not creating any values.
So with general managers included in discussion, we started having those discussions to identify wasteful activities.
So including President itself, he says he wants to join those meetings to hear out what are the problems, what are the pinpoints in the actual workplaces.
And in doing so, if there is any element of waste identified, we should discontinue those so that we can generate the truly necessary manner to be used for value-creating activities.
So those would be the starting point for eliminating wastes.
The fact that we are having these 2 parts in the press briefing, we've realized how valuable time is.
And you are joining us for those.
So my principle is that I don't want to talk about things that we are not doing, but we would like to properly convey to you what we are doing.
And if we want to do that, I want President's ideas and his thoughts to be presented to you.
Of course, the outcome is thanks to the efforts made by our suppliers, dealers and others.
So we would cover those in the financial result presentation first; and then that may -- it can be followed by President's own presentation talking about his own aspirations and strategy.
We received some criticisms.
We -- after President's presentation, that we'll have a media [scrum] and we'll talk -- myself and also Shirayanagi, talk about the answers that haven't been covered in the press conference.
Next question, please?
[Takahashi] of Sankei Shimbun newspaper.
In 2019, as of March, what's your outlook or the forecast of the Chinese market?
In consolidated result, it's a negative; but group total sales unit is positive.
In other words, you're expecting increase in -- occurring in China.
What's the details of the increase in China?
And then the equity-based, the consolidated company-based profit is likely to go down.
So are you thinking the profitability is deteriorated because of that?
Could you please give us more details on that?
Another question is that during the transaction of the Tokyo stock market, you are making this announcement.
Didn't you feel resistant to have this announcement where the stock market is still open?
Well, about the situation in China, well, in 2018, the market is still doing well, 30 million units or 29.8 million units is a very good condition.
Our sales figure, as of 2017, volume was 1.29 million.
Lexus and others are selling quite to a highest record in China; by 2018, 1.4 million units.
Therefore, as of December, the Camry was launched, Corolla was launched, and they are doing well.
And C-HR is now launched.
That's new in China.
So these are new models added in Chinese markets.
So we like to achieve the growth more than the average growth rate in the market.
As with the equity in earning of affiliated companies in China, of course, volume -- based upon the volume increased to -- we increased that, too.
So there's no deterioration sign in Chinese market at all in terms of profitability.
During the stock exchange operating, we are making this announcement today.
Of course, within the company, some people were reluctant to do this announcement, but we have 2 parts of the announcement.
You cannot have the session too late to invite you.
And first, of course, you need time to communicate to your head office as well, so we thought of all the consideration.
So automatically, this is the time we chose to have this press conference.
So that just -- we are not having this meeting just because we enjoy the increase of this earning income.
But whatever -- if you agree at this kind of format of a press conference, we will continue this format.
During the first quarter to the third quarter, we might make changes especially [a little bit] because we are so pleased to have President Toyoda to be with us today.
So we want him to really disclose what his real feeling and intention is.
So that's why we set up this meeting in this way.
In the next year and afterwards, do you intend to keep this kind of format of press conference?
Yes, we do these kinds of a meeting, yes.
We're running out of time, but we would like to entertain questions from as many people as possible.
So from hereon, may I restrict questions to 1 question per person.
Here, I would like to invite questions from Nagoya office.
We have 2 -- I would like to entertain questions from 2 journalists from Nagoya.
First, [Kyubu -- Chubu Keizai Shimbun, Yozaki] is my name.
Question to Mr.
Kobayashi.
Forecast for domestic sales is 1.53 million units.
You're talking about domestic production of about 3 million, and this domestic sales must be the foundation for that 3 million domestic production.
But at 1.53 million may be somewhat tough to preserve this 3 million.
How are you going to put an end to decline in domestic sales?
Could you share with us your views of that?
It is quite true that here in Japan, including population, the demographics, the conditions are not extremely exciting, and also the way in which vehicles are used.
Look at Tokyo, where people don't necessarily need vehicles; but in remote areas, people do need vehicles.
We don't think that this 1.53 million is acceptable.
But rather than simply changing the channel system when the sales are growing, we will be able to increase channels.
But what we need to do currently is to enhance and improve the services we offer customers, to make services readily accessible to customers.
So we have decided to assign individual Executive Vice President to different regions.
And by discussing closely with individuals, we want to make sure that the existing vehicles can be used in more enjoyable way.
And that's why we continue to aim at higher than 1.5 million units for domestic sales.
And what was the other aspect of the question?
Was there anything else?
I would like to invite another person from Nagoya to ask question, a journalist from Asahi Newspaper?
My name is [Yamamoto] from Asahi Newspaper.
And I would like to ask Mr.
Kobayashi about research and development expenditures.
You need to enhance this capability.
Otherwise, as you said, you will not be able to generate resources investing for a future technology.
For 5 years running, research and development expenses are increasing by JPY 1 trillion.
What is your view of this JPY 1 trillion?
Is it enough, or do you need to add further to be invested in research and development?
Your rivals -- new rivals, such as IT giants, Amazon, whatnot, they are spending more than 1.5x more compared to investment of Toyota.
What is your assessment of research and development expenses? (inaudible), you decided to invest more than JPY 300 billion in investing those (inaudible) together with DENSO and others.
And could you also share with us your thoughts on alliance, especially for autonomous driving, among others?
As you already know, when it comes to research and development, the more you allocate, the more you tend to spend.
What is important is what the research and development expenses are used for and when the results are going to be generated.
So you need to have a break at -- in place.
You need to introduce TPS and also cost reduction to the research and development efforts as well because all the researchers, engineers want to do whatever they want to do in researching or developing their efforts, so they tend to conduct those activities at full throttle.
But the company has its own overall objective, and therefore, we need to prioritize the research and development spending, aiming at the ultimate corporate objective; otherwise, it will simply continue spending.
And at this stage, we are making investments for the technology in the future, which -- including connectivity, among others, and they are not really generating earnings.
And since we are allocating more to those investments in new areas, we need to be more efficient in making research and development for existing areas to make it more effective.
And also, involving companies within Toyota Group, because take IT project at single company alone cannot conduct those research and development.
And therefore, by collaborating with the various companies within group or, in some cases, partners from other areas, we would like to continue those research and development to come up with the vehicles that can really satisfy our customers.
And other companies, I'm sure, are focusing on those priority areas, collaborating with us for research and development.
Another question from members in Tokyo, please?
[Tomioka] of Tokyokesai.
I have one question about R&D expenses.
Explain how about capital, the investment you are increasing, and JPY 1 trillion is amortization or depreciation costs now.
So the capital investment in facilities, especially Europe, is increasing.
In Japan, it's planning to increase.
So capital investment plan in the future outlook, what is your prioritized, the area of investment this time?
Yes, same as R&D because this -- you can depreciate that so that they have to look at the sales versus depreciation costs, otherwise, you can suffer from deficit.
Same as the R&D., you have to set a certain limit and then give priority.
Hybrid is emphasized in Europe, and then you need to increase the capacity to supply hybrid vehicle.
Domestically, in Japan, and TNG -- switching to TNG and then -- TNGA.
And then welfare and other things or building improvement, so other area where capital investment will be made.
So next question, please?
[Hans] of Automotive News.
For the fourth quarter, I would like you to elaborate on the details of the fourth quarter.
The operating income has increased here.
Why did that happen?
Could you cite some reasons behind that increase in operating income?
And also, could you also elaborate on the regional breakdown, the United States, for example, the fourth quarter?
First of all, with respect to the fourth quarter compared with the same period last fiscal year, our operating income increased by JPY 190.7 billion.
The exchange rate subtracted JPY 30 billion, but cost-reduction efforts generate7d JPY 30 billion positive.
Also, other sales activity is JPY 55 billion improvement.
And reduction in various expenses added JPY 145 billion.
This is an [important] factor.
And major factor in this area relates to the quality-related expenses.
The number of [period fixes] decreased in this period.
And also, there has been some pause in this area, including Takata-related issues.
And we are making efforts to reduce those period fixes from the customers' perspective.
And those efforts started generating benefits, especially starting in fourth quarter.
And that caused the increase in operating income in the fourth quarter.
I don't have the regional breakdown, so allow me to refrain from commenting on that.
I suppose you have additional questions, but unfortunately, time is running short, so we can entertain just one more question.
Thank you.
[News Sokrat Net Media,] I'm (inaudible).
My question is to Mr.
Kobayashi, EVP.
Mr.
Kobayashi, you became a Vice President, and then it was a shocking news to the people inside Toyota and outside.
I was also shocked myself.
The reason, is that, that you are a bit older than the others?
And you might have changed, but you are above this retirement age of the executives.
And then you are not a director in the head office, but you had a great achievement.
But you were still promoted to the headquarters of Toyota again.
So when you accepted this offer, how did you interpret this offer and the intention of Mr.
Toyoda to offer you this position?
As earlier people asked the question and you responded this well that, Mr.
Kobayashi, in your role, function, is that inside as well as outside, you would be in charge of reorganizing the group companies within Toyota.
That's interpretation of your function by other people.
But what do you think of this expectation?
You came back to Toyota TMC from DENSO.
What's the difference?
Did you feel something different now?
The humor, first, in the management, I cannot make my own decision.
It was decision made by President Toyoda himself.
I really wondered and had a (inaudible).
I'm already 70 year old, older than others.
But in Japan, I think everyone needs to keep working, I think, in the future in Japan.
So when you think of retirement standard and other criteria, I was not a director in the head office and so on, but everything was taken to account by Mr.
Toyoda, and he himself made the decision.
So it's not something I should comment on.
But I feel severe heavy responsibility.
I worked with him for many years.
Even in DENSO, I had the communication -- close communication with President Toyoda.
And then his aspirations and his thoughts I think I fully understand.
So my role, my function is, as I mentioned earlier, that his strategy and his wishes and comments and feelings should be quickly perceived myself to try to implement that inside as well as outside.
Starting on January 1, I started that task to be implemented, as I said.
There was a bit of confusion inside the company, but I would like to be persistent to try to communicate with each employee of the company and other members and stakeholders to implement this reorganization of the Toyota Group.
It's not clearly defined as my duty.
There are 6 Executive President, Vice Presidents and President and others, who and I should talk to each other.
And then maybe the President himself decided that I should keep this task for the time being.
But within the group, power should be fully maximally utilized.
So I think that the organization is really streamlined and improved to make the full capacity.
And then my impression after coming back to Toyota from DENSO, well, for each company has its own merits and demerits and unique features, characteristics, so I cannot just simply explain what's the difference.
But in both companies, you have to unite your efforts, and then both companies have that good teamwork really working well.
That's all.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Since the time has gone to complete the first part, I would like to complete the first part of this press briefing.
And as was mentioned by Kobayashi, once the second part is over, both Kobayashi and Shirayanagi will stay on to receive your questions, so please join them for that as well.
Thank you very much.
