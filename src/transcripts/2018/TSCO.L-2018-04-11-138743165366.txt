Full Year 2018 Tesco PLC Earnings Call (Debt Investor)
Welcome to the Tesco debt investor call. (Operator Instructions).
And just to remind you, this call is being recorded.
So today I'm pleased to present Alan Stewart, Group CFO; and Lynda Heywood, Group Treasurer.
Alan, please begin.
Thanks very much, Hugh.
Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us for the debt investor call on the announcement of our preliminary results to the 2018-19 financial year.
A number of you may have dialed in earlier during the day, so if you have, please forgive me.
There is some repetition, obviously, with what we spoke about earlier; but, equally, we'll cover this with the understandable particular focus, as it's a debt call, on the balance sheet and what that means.
I'm joined by Lynda, as Hugh said.
And without further ado, if you don't mind, we will just go into the full-year results.
I'll say as I move from one slide to the next, because you should be able to follow it in terms of the presentation.
So during the year, we've delivered another strong year of progress, and we remain firmly on track to achieve our medium-term ambitions.
The momentum in sales has continued, and we saw positive growth of 2.3% at actual rates.
The fourth quarter of the year that we -- just reporting on represented the ninth consecutive quarter of sales growth for both the Group and for our UK and Ireland division.
We've also delivered strong profit growth, up 28.4% year on year to GBP1.64 billion, with growth in every segment.
The UK and Ireland, which as you know is a very significant part of our business, made strong progress in the year, achieving an operating profit of GBP1.05 billion, up 31.1%.
This enabled us to finish the year strongly with an operating margin for the Group in the second half of 3%.
And importantly, we had another year of strong retail cash generation, up 21.7% to GBP2.8 billion.
If we move to the next slide and talk a little bit about the UK performance.
And you know we placed a significant emphasis on fresh food as the driver of our recovery over the past few years.
We're pleased to have delivered positive fresh food volume growth of 0.7% in the year, driven by continued improvement in our customer offer.
As expected, we've continued to see a drag from our efforts to deemphasize certain parts of our general merchandise business in order to shift the focus to more profitable lines, with GM volumes down 7.2%.
We further refined our range, reducing the number of SKUs by 16%; and reducing sales in certain categories, such as electronics, by more than 10%.
We're still focused on driving growth in profitable, sustainable categories of general merchandise.
The introduction of our Go Cook and Fox & Ivy ranges has been extremely successful, driving a 14% and 20% increase in customers to our cookware and homeware categories, respectively.
Overall, we've seen 260,000 more customers shopping with us year-on-year, with average basket spend up 2.5%.
This has enabled us to continue to improve profitability, with operating margins for the UK and Ireland segment up 50 basis points year on year.
If we now move to the next slide, which shows a bit more detail around the financial impact, and how there's a -- and being delivered in the UK.
We've seen strong like-for-like sales growth, as I mentioned, of 2.3% for the year, maintaining similar levels throughout every quarter of the year.
The fresh food category, strong volume growth of 0.7%, corresponds to a market outperformance in fresh food of 1.7%.
This is driven by a particularly strong performance in meat, fish, and poultry, where -- and, overall, our total food volume outperformance was 1.4%.
We've continued to see strong customer take-up of our own brand products, helped by the ongoing relaunch which started last November.
Own brand now accounts for 51% of total sales, up nearly 1 full percentage point year-on-year.
As usual, we have included details in terms of like-for-like sales and channel analysis in the full pack which we showed and released this morning.
And from that, when you look at them, you'll see that we've had a particularly strong performance in our large stores.
Our superstore like-for-like sales in the UK were up 2.6%, with Extras up 1.8%.
We saw over 5% growth in grocery home shopping once again, driven by increases in both order numbers and in basket size.
As you can see from the waterfall on the right of this chart, operating margin increased by 50 basis points to 2.3%.
Despite the significant investment we made in price in the first half, as we held back more inflation for our customers than the rest of the market was passing through, we've seen a net benefit from volume, mix, and price for the year as a whole.
Our cost-saving plan delivered a reduction in costs in the UK of GBP404 million, more than offsetting the cost inflation we've seen.
Within our operating margin -- so whilst our operating margin improved a significant year on year, given the shape of our investment, this is even more marked in the second half, strengthening nearly 70 basis points to 2.5%.
I should note, at this point, that the UK and operating -- UK and Ireland operating profit before exceptional items includes transaction costs and fees of GBP21 million relating to the merger with Booker.
This is consistent with the treatment we adopted last year when we had GBP26 million of costs also charged through the operating profit before exceptional items line.
In the year ahead, we expect a similar level of costs in respect of stamp duty payable on completion of the merger.
If we now move to the next slide, which covers the Central European performance.
We've delivered like-for-like sales growth in food of plus 1.2%, with fresh food again being a key focus.
This strong performance continues to be offset by a drag from general merchandise as we refocus our offer, similar to what we're doing in the UK.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia continue to deliver strong like-for-like sales growth.
And we've made good progress in Poland, which continues to be a very competitive market, generating positive like-for-like sales growth in this market throughout the second half of the year.
Whilst it's too early to assess the full impact of the legislative changes which recently took effect in Poland concerning Sunday trading, they may have some impact on the year ahead.
We've seen significant progress in our convenience source -- store format across Central Europe, with all areas contributing positively to a like-for-like sales growth of plus 3.2%.
We've been particularly pleased at the increase in operating profit before exceptional items in the region.
Profits more than doubled year on year to GBP119 million, with operating margin up 87 basis points to 1.8%.
Our efforts to reduce costs have made a significant contribution to this improvement in profit, particularly with the benefit of more effective stock management.
The opening of a new distribution center in Slovakia serving the whole region has allowed continued progress towards operation in the four markets we serve as one business.
Moving now to the next slide, which covers our Asia segment.
As we mentioned throughout the year, the headline sales numbers are significantly impacted by the strategic decision taken in Thailand to remove unprofitable bulk selling and mass couponing activities in order to focus on sustainable, profitable sales growth.
This change annualizes during the first quarter of this year.
The change to bulk selling has driven around a negative 6% impact, with the reduction in couponing driving around another negative 3%.
When stripping out this impact, Asia's like-for-like sales were down around 1%, which largely reflects our investment in price across the region.
You can see from the waterfall, to the right of this chart, the impact of these strategic decisions.
We have continued to invest in keeping prices low for our customers and have seen a benefit in volume and mix.
We've also made significant progress in our cost savings program, saving a total of GBP120 million in the Asia segment during the year.
Throughout the year, we've seen further improvement in profitability.
And despite the full-year deflation of around 1%, in our operating profit margin is up nearly 1 full percentage point to 6%.
If we now move to the sources and uses of cash, this waterfall represents how we think about these within the business.
If we begin on the left-hand side, we'd start with GBP2.466 million, GBP2.5 billion, of cash from retail operations, driven by continued improvements in the profitability of the business.
Following this, we've had a very positive working capital inflow of GBP499 million.
You should be aware that this includes a GBP102 million timing benefit driven by trade payables arising from the Palmer & Harvey administration towards the end of the year.
We expect this to reverse in the current financial year.
Aside from this, the key benefit to working capital is from a variety of stock management initiatives across the whole of our business.
Exceptional cash items resulted in an outflow of GBP192 million.
These are made up of GBP149 million payments in relation to that deferred prosecution agreement with the SFO and the related shareholder compensation scheme.
There's GBP120 million of restructuring costs, and GBP92 million of onerous lease utilizations.
These outflows were offset by GBP160 million we recovered from HMRC regarding the treatment of VAT on Clubcard rewards.
HMRC has appealed this decision, so there is a possibility of a cash outflow in the future, should their appeal be successful.
Overall, this leads to a retail operating cash flow GBP2.77 billion, an increase of 21.7% year on year.
Our cash capital expenditure of GBP1.2 billion includes around GBP200 million impact from the payment this year of prior-year accruals.
Net interest and tax payments of GBP428 million were GBP113 million lower year on year, largely as a result of our maturing debt and the two [liability] management exercises we undertook during the year.
Lynda will discuss these in more detail shortly.
Net profit transactions include 10 store buybacks in the second half of the year following on from our transaction with British Land at the beginning of the financial year.
This is offset by GBP253 million of proceeds from property sales, including the sale of our Hackney store in the first half, and a number of other sites in the UK and Central Europe.
We raised GBP362 million through disposals and dividends received, primarily driven by the sale of our remaining minority stake in Lazada, which is the online business, and our opticians business to Vision Express.
As well is we recorded a GBP50 million dividend from Tesco Bank.
The result is an overall free cash flow for the year of GBP1.377 million, GBP1.4 billion.
Looking at CapEx at the next slide, our CapEx for the full year was GBP1.1 billion and continues to be largely made up of retaining and replacing essential assets.
In the UK, within the GBP677 million, we allocated CapEx to repurposing 20 Extra stores.
And we also had CapEx on a small amount of new store openings, primarily in the Express store format.
Within the year, we opened over 50 concessions within our stores in the UK, with Arcadia Group, Holland & Barrett, Dixons Carphone, and Next.
The GBP133 million in Central Europe relates mainly to repurposing of existing stores.
In Asia, the GBP239 million relates to 69 new stores we've opened, mainly in Thailand; and the repurposing of 34 stores.
And just to reiterate, we continue to expect CapEx to remain between GBP1.1 billion and GBP1.4 billion per annum, based on our current plans, and at this early stage in the year.
And we expect to see our spend towards the top end of this range in the 2018-19 financial year.
Turning to pensions.
We covered this in some detail at the interims.
But to recap, the most significant update was the conclusion of the triannual actuarial valuation, confirming the deficit at GBP3.0 billion.
We confirmed, at the same time, a small increase in annual contributions of GBP15 million to GBP285 million effective from April 2018, which is where we are now, with our long-term funding framework remaining unchanged.
We also covered the significant reduction in the IAS 19 pension deficit, so I won't repeat all the detail here again.
But you can see from the waterfall on this chart that it is reduced from GBP6.6 billion to GBP3.2 billion pre-tax, and to GBP2.7 billion post-tax over the year.
The other thing I will point out is that there's been relatively mild movement and a relatively moderate movement from the August position through to the end-of-February position, which is testament to the way that we are looking at this in terms of the predictability of cash flows.
I'll now hand over to Lynda to talk us a bit through about the progress we've made on the balance sheet.
Okay.
Thanks, Alan.
Good afternoon, everyone.
So starting on balance sheet now with slide 11.
We've made significant further progress over this year towards strengthening our balance sheet, with net debt reducing to GBP2.6 billion.
We have also seen a GBP509 million reduction in our lease commitments, which includes the benefit of the buyback of 17 stores over the course of this year.
And we've also seen a reduction of GBP2.8 billion in the IAS 19 pension deficit, as Alan has just mentioned.
So total indebtedness now stands at GBP12 billion, a GBP9 billion reduction from 2014, with lower net debt driving around half of this reduction.
Moving on, you'll see the chart which shows the significant progress we've made on -- over the past three years on our key debt metrics.
Our intention remains to return to an investment grade credit rating, with our key threshold metrics being fixed charge cover in excess of 3 times, and total indebtedness of less than 3 times EBITDA, based on our internal definitions of these metrics.
Looking at the debt reduction, we're giving you some more color here on slide 13 on our progress on gross debt within the year.
During the year, we repaid a total of GBP2.7 billion debt, consisting of debt maturities of GBP1.4 billion and two bond tenders.
The first tender took place in July 2017, concluding with a repurchase of GBP500 million of our longest dated debt.
Following this, in October, we repurchased a further GBP800 million of debt.
As you can see from this slide, we targeted bonds with high coupon rates to maximize the return.
The exception to this was our eurobond maturing in 2019, which we repurchased to help smooth our debt maturity profile.
The tenders alone results in an annualized interest savings of around GBP50 million.
The chart on page 14 shows that as a result of the tenders and the repayments during the year, our gross debt has reduced to stand at GBP6.2 billion at year-end.
We've also significantly reduced our overdrafts to GBP0.4 billion.
As we explained at the interims, we have no CP outstanding, and this overdraft is a function of our notional pooling arrangement.
The reduction during the year has come from cash repatriation by our operating businesses.
The proportion of our debt which is euros-denominated has increased following debt repayment.
However, as the majority of this is hedged back to sterling, so the proportion of our euro debt remains unchanged at 23%.
Looking at our credit spreads, last year we highlighted, with this same chart, the decoupling of the Tesco CDS from the Itraxx Crossover index, of which we are a constituent.
In the last year, we have seen this trend continue with our CDS and bond spreads tightening further.
This was further accelerated by our interim results and tender offer in October, which triggered 30 basis points of tightening, and drove our spreads down towards the investment-grade index, which has been maintained even with recent market volatility.
And now just to summarize, this year represents continued strong progress, leaving us firmly on track to deliver our medium-term targets.
We've delivered another year of growth in sales, profits, and cash.
We continue to increase profitability across the Group with operating margin reaching 3% in the second half.
We've also made substantial progression on our cost-saving program, with total cost savings of GBP594 million in the year, and GBP820 million of savings to date.
We continue to strengthen the balance sheet, with GBP2.7 billion of debt repaid within the year.
And finally, our dividend demonstrates the Board's confidence in our ongoing recovery.
I'll hand back to Alan now to talk a little bit about Booker.
Thanks, Lynda.
So, a bit of update of an update on Booker, which, as you understand, is relatively new to us.
We completed the merger five weeks ago on March 5.
So there's not a huge update, but I thought it would be useful to give you some context around where we are, and how we're looking at this as we start realizing the synergies we set out in the prospectus.
First of all, though, in terms of Booker's results, now Booker obviously is no longer a listed company.
So what we have done today in order to close out the period from a Booker shareholder perspective, which would otherwise be unknown to you -- the unaudited results for Booker are presented on slide -- I think it's 14 -- 16, 17 of your deck. 18.
Whatever it is, Booker is unaudited.
The Q4 -- and this is the way that Booker always has (technical difficulty) business, consistent with the way that Charles Wilson has previously spoken about it.
Customer satisfaction, which is the first and most important measure which the Booker management team looks at, is up a further 30 basis points on the Q3 number to 85.7%.
The like-for-like sales in Booker in the quarter were up 9.9%, representing strong growth in their business.
And the operating profit for the full year, ending the end of March, at GBP195 million, represents a strong growth over the previous year.
This is before exceptional items, of course, but represents really the business that we will be -- that will form part of the broader, enlarged Tesco Group in the current financial year.
And finally, GBP120 million of net cash is on the Booker balance sheet as of the end of that period.
And this is net of payments of final dividends that Booker declared and has now paid to its shareholders before its year end.
We consolidate Booker from -- with effect from March 5; so in the year that we're in, we'll have 51 weeks of the Booker results included within our numbers.
If we move on to the next slide, we've spoken a number of times about joining forces with Booker.
And we were very really delighted that on March 5.
We were able to complete the merger on time and as proposed originally, with a strong vote from both our shareholders and Booker's shareholders in favor of the merger.
We reconfirmed that the synergy benefits from a cost perspective that we were expecting were at least GBP175 million, and at least GBP25 million of revenue synergies.
We also looked at other areas, if we turn on to the next slide, of where we would unlock new growth.
And the four areas here are ones which we can talk a little bit about now.
When we speak about range optimization, we're thinking about how it is that what Booker supplies to its customers can be available to Tesco customers; and, equally, what Tesco supplies to its customers could potentially be available to Booker customers.
And we started with that immediately the merger completed with setting up Booker as a supplier to Tesco.
So in a number of stores, a small number of stores, we've taken around 30 Booker products, mainly catering and related products and catering sizes, and we've made them available to Tesco shoppers.
We're really pleased with the performance of those in the five weeks.
It is still early days.
But if you look at that from our perspective, those products are already generating the necessary sales densities in those stores where we're trialing them.
And we're equally look at -- it takes a bit more time -- but what products that we are supplying that are Tesco products might be of benefit to Booker customers.
In terms of formats, we've opened and have trialed, only a few weeks, as well, up at our Bar Hill's store in Cambridgeshire, a Chef Central concept which is within space which previously was part of a Dobbies outlet.
Dobbies exited that store at the time that we sold the Dobbies business around 18 months ago.
And we've put in there an offering which is available to customers in the Cambridgeshire area, whether they are retail customers or professional customers.
So, early days; and encouraged by the learnings we see from that, but it is very early days.
If we then think about how that [can] be made available in that area, that store -- this isn't you -- something which is started yet.
But if we think about the utilization of our dot-com vehicles, why wouldn't customers who are currently Booker customers be able to be served from that store with the Chef Central produce as well as the -- any Tesco product which was of interest to them, with a high utilization of vehicles.
But as I think we spoke about at the last call, if you are a professional catering customer, you are most interested in the deliveries being delivered early in the day, which is the time when our retail customers, from a Tesco perspective, are least interested in deliveries.
They tend to be in the middle and end of the day that retail customers are looking at that.
And then finally, we continue to see real opportunities for click and collect, mobile, and banking by putting the two businesses together, and offering customers in each of the businesses, elements of that.
The synergies we've set out; and as I said a few minutes ago, GBP200 million of synergies over three years.
We've given a little bit of shape to this.
We expect to generate around GBP60 million in the first year; around GBP40 million (sic - see slide 21, "GBP140 million"), cumulative, in the second year; and then to get GBP200 million by the end of the third year.
And the costs remain consistent with what we put in the prospectus, at less than GBP145 million.
The final (technical difficulty) this synergy slide is the revenue aspiration, which we believe and is potentially there; and which when we started talking to our supplier partners across both businesses -- and we've now engaged with the top 39 of those supplier partners -- this is the aspiration and the opportunity that we see available to us.
Now, there's a long way between talking about that and delivering it.
And the GBP25 million that we've spoken about forms a small part of this.
But we're really clear that this is an opportunity and an aspiration which we will seek with our supplier partners to deliver, because that's growth for us and growth for them.
If we then move on to the principles with which we are managing this.
These are important because when we bring the two businesses together, it's important that we're both operating in a very similar way.
And one of the things which was important as we looked to bring the two businesses together was the realization that actually we look at the world very, very similarly, whether we were operating as Booker or whether we were operating (technical difficulty) over the recent years.
So the purpose is very clearly serving Britain's customers a little better every day, unchanged in terms of the direction.
And the Booker business has been absolutely focused on customers, as Tesco has been, and remains.
The values worked for both Tesco and for Booker, and we've had no change in those.
So those values of no one tries harder for customers, treating people how they want to be treated, and every little help making a big difference, are equally appropriate whether you are working and operating in the Booker part of our business or in the Tesco business.
We then looked at the operating principles.
Booker spoke about health, safe, and legal.
We've equally been very, very clear on always wanting to and needing to do the right thing.
We would never compromise safety, health, or legal trading in Tesco, so we've adopted that.
Customer satisfaction maps exactly across the two businesses.
Cash profitability is something we've just spoken about very strongly; and, equally, it's been a key tenet of Charles Wilson in the way that he's run Booker over the last 10 years.
And we're focusing very -- the whole of the team and the joining forces team, on achieving the minimum change -- the maximum benefit with the minimum change, which is the 20/80 rule.
How can we achieve as much as we can with doing as little as we can?
We are one team, and I think our supplier partners that we started talking to have been impressed with the way that we are one team.
And we have specialized channel expertise, whether it's in retail, whether it's in wholesale, or whether it's online.
And that's a key principle.
And then finally, going right back to the origins of Tesco's success and the founding principles that Jack Cohen spoke about and wrote about.
This rather long string of letters is something which, if you'll forgive me, stands for You Can't Do Business Sitting on Your Ass.
And speed of operation is something which you're really wanting everybody to focus on.
So those are the principles with which the two businesses are coming together, and they really are a melding of the way we've been operating.
And if we then turn to the penultimate slide, the sustainable value creation for shareholders.
What we've set out on the left-hand side are the medium-term ambitions with which we've informed our stakeholders as regards how we're going to be measured in terms of the business performance; and the turnaround, the 3.5% to 4%; the GBP9 billion of cash, underpinned by the GBP1.5 billion of cost savings.
But in truth, the philosophy underlying that, which is increasingly the way we're going to be looking at our business, remains absolutely the same, and is that we are focused on cash profitability.
There is no margin target that we have in our business.
We've set out our aspirations, but nobody has targeted within the business on delivering a particular margin.
We're focused on earnings growth, and we're focused on free cash flow because that free cash flow is the lifeblood of our business.
So that's really the way that we will be looking at bringing these two businesses together, and delivering on them as we focused on that GBP2.5 billion of opportunity and aspiration that we've seen.
And so in summary, and we look at the -- not only the year, but also the last three years, we are delivering against our six strategic drivers.
We've seen continued momentum in our performance, with sales up, profits up, cash up, and debt significantly down.
We are shifting the mix and we're getting more customers into Tesco.
We've strengthened the balance sheet, as Lynda has shown.
And we are very confident that the UK's leading food business can unlock significant future growth.
So, with that, I'll hand it over to queue (technical difficulty) and thank you for your time.
(Operator Instructions).
Sam Ross, Allianz Global Investors.
Earlier in the presentation, you mentioned that it was your intention to return to investment grade ratings.
And I'm just wondering, what do you expect the timing to be on that?
And how do the internal metrics that you calculate compare with rating agency assumptions?
Because it seems that they often add an extra premium, as it were, onto your leverage calculation.
And so I'm just wondering if you've had the conversation with them to see whether or not your 3 times adjusted leverage target will be sufficient to get you back up to investment grade.
Thank you.
Thanks, Sam.
I'll answer a bit, and then let Lynda take up.
So the -- we are very clear that the rating agencies are the ones who make the decision on this, and that the way that they look at this is both quantitative and also qualitative, and we would never be seeking to make the answer for them.
That's for them to decide.
The -- equally, we engage with them on a regular basis, and we will be doing so after this results announcement.
But obviously you'll understand that we haven't yet have those conversations ahead of today.
But I'll let Lynda talk a little bit more about how our metrics map into the rating agency metrics.
So I think it's right to say, obviously, we fully understand the rating agency metrics.
They are -- they have some quite complex adjustments, and they are not the same across all three agencies.
So the metrics that we use are a simplified version that can be pulled from our accounts.
However, there is a mapping; so they are consistent with the output from the rating agency metrics, and we're fully aware of how that mapping works.
(multiple speakers) We believe that the threshold that we set would be consistent with an investment grade quantitative metric across the agencies.
And we've spent a lot of time talking to them about their model and how we look at things.
We haven't fully had that discussion, but we're very clear that we understand how they look at the world. (multiple speakers) Or how they have looked at the world up until now.
Yes, great.
Thank you very much.
[Can Santoli], BNP Paribas.
I have three questions.
The first question is: how do you see your leverage if the Booker merger was completed at the end of your financial year 2017?
So what do you see the deleveraging impact on Tesco?
That's the first question.
The second question is around the level of gross debt you're comfortable with going forward.
Ultimately a return to IG would depend also on Moody's.
That looks at your leverage on a gross adjusted basis.
And the third question is: of the GBP3.2 billion of cash you have on balance sheet, post- the Booker transaction, how much of this is stuck in tills or in transit?
And what level of cash do you think is appropriate for a business like Tesco to run with?
I'll let Lynda answer the second and third.
But in terms of the overall impact of the Booker transaction, what we said in the prospectus, and remains the case, is that we could see some improvement in the leverage metrics as the benefits of the transaction come through.
But clearly, what we will be trying to achieve in respect of those synergies which I spoke about, wherever we can see them more achievable more quickly, we will seek to achieve that.
Wherever we can achieve them at less cost, we will seek to achieve that.
And we're primarily, in the first instance, focusing on achieving the GBP200 million.
If there is any more of that, then we will also go after that.
So the statement in the prospectus about the leverage metrics being improved as the benefits are delivered is consistent with the GBP200 million.
But obviously if there -- if any of those things change for the positive, then that's helpful.
I should say that they're not significant drivers of increased performance.
The Booker business delivers around just under GBP200 million, or delivered just under GBP200 million of cash in the year.
It's got a relatively low depreciation charge.
And its operating profit, its EBIT, tends to translate into cash on a pretty matched basis.
So overall -- and we've got another GBP120 million which comes into our business.
So there will be some improvement, but it's not a significant driver if you take away the -- it's much more about the Tesco business, in truth, about the deleveraging.
Then Lynda may want to cover gross debt and what cash is in the business.
Okay.
So yes, on gross debt, so obviously we're very aware that Moody's looks at gross debt, and we've had many conversations with them about it.
Clearly, we have taken some action this year to reduce our gross debt.
But reducing it going forward would depend on the amount of cash we have available and the ability for us to reduce gross debt in a way that is economically viable.
So, I think there's no hard and fast answer to your question.
Clearly we're focused on that metric, too, in the way that Moody's calculates it.
And we do as much as we can do reduce our gross debt, as we have been doing.
But I think that more than that, I probably can say.
On -- you asked about cash in tills and unavailable.
I think we could probably say that there is about GBP1 billion of cash that is in transit.
So what we mean by that is not only cash in tills but also uncleared cash, effectively.
So it's in the process of being cleared through the bank.
So that's an amount that is -- a small amount in different pockets that have -- that are not available.
They have to be held separately for one reason -- ring-fenced for one reason or another.
So we have that amount.
And I think you also asked -- so perhaps four questions -- about the level of cash that a business such as ours should hold.
I would say again that we work with a -- so whenever we're looking at discretionary cash spend, and we would look -- and this is after the CapEx, et cetera -- we would look to always maintain a buffer of cash within the business, which is significant, but covers our working capital.
And can I quickly follow up on Alan's point on the Booker transaction?
If you look at the pro forma numbers and compare it to your threshold that you put out of 3 times, you are currently at 3.3 times.
So if pro forma Booker, do you think that would be closer to 3 or somewhere in between 3.3 and 3?
I think I'd rather let the market form its view on what the combination is.
And I think that during the course of following today's announcement -- and, in fact, in the lead-in; but more importantly, following today's announcement -- over the next short period of time, I'd expect to see a combined Group view and consensus emerging of what the combined business does.
Booker was growing at about 10% per annum, and that's been the case at which it was growing.
As I said, it translates its operating profit into cash.
Its CapEx was historically between GBP20 million and GBP30 million; no reason why that would change as a business unit within Tesco enlarged Group.
But I think I'd rather let the market work out than comment specifically on how that maths might work.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Rebecca Clements, Fidelity International.
I have a couple of questions.
The first one: I guess this dovetails a little bit with previous questions; but, realistically, how much more debt reduction can we expect?
Are you going to continue to take the approach that as debt matures that you will pay that down with cash?
Or should we consider that you might also look to refinance that?
Because you do have a decent amount of maturities in the next couple of years that you would potentially pay down.
I'd rather ask that one first, and then move onto the next one.
Okay, okay.
Fair enough.
Okay, so I think we have cash; we have cash generation.
And the base plan is that we have enough cash to repay our upcoming debt maturities.
And when you say upcoming, are you talking about like next 12 months' maturities?
Or (multiple speakers)?
That for sure, yes.
Yes.
But look, from a philosophical perspective, and if we can talk philosophically rather than and specifically, I think the what we -- we've always been clear that we saw no reason why we wouldn't be an investment grade issuer as the turnaround came, and we wanted to be an investment grade issuer.
That's not for us to decide, but we have our own internal metrics which we believe put us within that range, even if we're not called that externally.
We're clearly not there yet; and, therefore, hypothetically, we won't talk about what would be, if we were in that range.
But the trajectory of the intention remains very clear on our part.
Linked to that is obviously the business performance, the outlook, the environment, and our maturity profile.
But there comes a point at which we are certainly aren't saying that we're not going to be a company without any leverage in it.
And there's -- so from a philosophical perspective, there is a point at which the degree to which we have maturities or debt outstanding, we need to think about from a longer-term profile perspective.
And that's something which we do think about, and we will continue to think about.
But it's linked firstly towards getting ourselves into the position where we are comfortable that we -- the threshold is one which is achievable in there.
But you'll appreciate as well, we're equally always cautious that we are not giving signals which might be totally misunderstood by the market as to what we're thinking of doing.
Okay.
I guess it's just from -- it would be a natural way for you to continue to deleverage.
And obviously if you do generate future growth, that will also help you deleverage.
But from a gross debt reduction, to me, is always demonstrating a commitment that -- a genuine commitment to leverage reduction.
I know a lot of companies -- and I'm not speaking about you guys -- kind of like to use a net debt number and say that, oh, but it's going down; but then they never actually pay down any gross debt.
Which, depending on how the cash flows, ends up not actually being (multiple speakers)
Yes, no, no.
Understood.
But from our perspective, we're equally focused on the efficiency of our balance sheet and the cash that's in our balance sheet; and the borrowings, and the cost of those borrowings.
And our action last year speaks to support that.
I totally agree.
And the tenders were, I think, a little bit of a surprise.
But I'm guessing that it's probably less likely, given your maturities, that you'll be looking at any significant tenders this year.
Although I could be wrong on that.
Well, we're not going to comment on your guesses, are we?
No, fair enough.
In terms of working capital, on your guidance slide you have a GBP200 million decline in your guidance in working capital.
Can we translate that as being equivalent to a GBP200 million inflow of cash?
Is that the right way to (multiple speakers)?
That's the way I'd like you to -- yes, that's the way I'd like you to think about it.
We're saying, in the medium-term, as we've shown this year, there has been considerable focus in the business and success in the business in generating working capital from stock.
We've been very clear in terms of our payment terms.
We published our payment terms and we hold to those.
So this is all about genuine velocity of cash, getting stock out of our system, and improving the working capital through that.
I think it would be fair to say that it's not something which we could see carrying on forever.
But for that next year, few years at least, we can see around GBP200 million per annum; and, that, you should think about as cash.
There are -- and we called them out in the release, and I mentioned a few -- there are some elements within the cash that we generated this year, which are timing differences.
And in the analyst call this morning, I was clear that there are some elements of payment timings which, over the next couple of years, may cause what would appear to be some lumpiness in our cash flows as we look at them.
So, one of the things about Tesco is that the numbers are always large.
So when I look at the impact of a changing regime in the UK for payments and account for tax, I'm conscious that the HMRC are bringing forward the time at which payments on account are going to have to be made.
That's a permanent outflow.
It's a one-off event, but it will impact us.
And dependent on our underlying profitability and therefore tax payable at the time, we'd have some years in which coupon payments on debt fall, and sometimes twice.
That can be some benefit.
And in the current year, we had the impact as a positive from the failure of Palmer & Harvey, which gave us around GBP160 million of benefit which we'd you expect to unwind in the current year.
And we've had a -- we still have GBP60 million of cash to pay out in respect to the shareholder compensation scheme which we accrued last year -- in the 2017-18 year, in fact -- but which remains unpaid as at the end of the February 2018 year.
So there are some moving parts.
But, broadly, we're clear that generate the cash from the business; generate working capital; and then generate free cash flow after CapEx, interest, and tax.
And ignoring the one-offs (multiple speakers), the main driver of the working capital improvement will probably be continued stock -- improved stock management?
Yes, exactly.
Okay.
And you actually brought up something I was also going to ask about.
On the HMRC change payment on account, could you just explain a little more what that is?
I was unfamiliar with that.
Yes, and very happy to.
So in the UK, as a corporate, you pay tax on a quarterly basis on accounts.
And the -- it's not in the 2018-19 year.
I think it's the 2019-20 year, there is -- that payment of account is going to be brought forward by six months for the whole of the UK corporate environment.
And that will be just an outflow of cash which corporates are going to have to deal with.
I'll come back -- it's subject to correction as to exactly when that is; but Lynda and team can confirm what that is, Rebecca, the timing.
But it's been well flagged.
It is some time out.
But as people are looking at cash flows over the -- not only the 2018-19 year, but beyond, I just want people to be aware that we're looking, as well, and there are some things which on our side are controllable and will impact on that.
Okay.
And then my last question is: from your own internal perspective, how long do you think it will be before -- well actually, from your perspective, and also for us as investors, given how regularly we hear from you -- how long will it be before we can have confidence that the Booker integration is going smoothly?
I appreciate that it's already five weeks in, and going well.
But just to make sure that -- what period of time do you need in order to say, you know what?
Things are going fine, and we're not worried about any kind of blips at this point.
Well, what we said, internally we're looking at this right up to Board level on a -- through our periodic reporting.
So every period in terms of the synergy tracking, we're looking at it.
We have the former Chief Executive of Booker, now Chief Executive of the UK and Irish segment.
So again, very close day-to-day.
From your external perspective and in terms of the external marking of it, we will be updating on a yearly basis as we tell the market how we're doing.
The full benefits, as we showed, are expected to be delivered over the three years, so it will be a three-year reporting against that.
But on every six months, we'll be talking about how Booker is.
Okay. (multiple speakers)
Sorry; what I would add is that this is very unusual.
And you really need to -- this isn't an integration in what's very usually understood by when two companies come together.
The -- this is a separate channel which is operating as a separate -- very separately and alongside.
It's got a different customer base.
It's got a different way of operating.
And we're not disturbing any of that at all.
What we are talking about is how we can get benefit from the supply to that channel and our own existing channels.
And that's where, by far, the majority of the synergy benefits that we highlighted were: over GBP100 million of the GBP175 million benefits came there.
The second area of benefit is in the ensuring that the flow of goods servicing both of those channels through distribution were optimized, and that was the second element of benefit.
But that doesn't mean significant integration.
What it means is just making sure that we flow goods most efficiently between the two networks.
And then a very small element of the synergies, less than 10% of the GBP175 million of cost synergies, were relating to goods and services not for retail.
Again, just buying [best] what services and goods that we are using within our businesses, and a very small element of people overlap.
So the risks around integration are very different from normally what you think about when two businesses come together.
Okay.
Thanks very much.
(Operator Instructions).
Toby Hunston, Insight Investment.
Just [a second] a few numbers on my side.
Just firstly on Booker, I think the cash outflow was down a GBP760-odd million.
Is that still the case, that number?
Yes, that's right, Toby.
Okay.
And then you'd previously given us an available cash number.
I think at the end of last year, it was GBP3 billion which was sort of the reported cash, excluding cash in tills, excluding that cash you need for Booker.
So could you give us that number again now of what you consider to be fully available cash that you don't need day to day?
It's about GBP1.7 billion.
GBP1.7 billion.
Okay, thanks.
And then just final question.
In terms of the GBP9 billion cash from operations guidance: just plugging in the last two years, assuming I'm using the right ones, does that imply about a GBP3.6 billion of cash from operations this year?
And if that's right, then below that line, what exceptionals?
Because I think that's -- you used the before exceptionals definition for that.
So, what sort of cash exceptionals should there be this year coming?
Because I think in this year just gone, it was about -- a net of about GBP200 million outflow on the exceptionals.
Thanks.
Yes.
And look, by their very nature, exceptionals are exceptional, and we don't plan for exceptionals.
So the answer there is that would come against that number.
That number is for pension contribution; so pension deficit contribution, which is GBP285 million as of April this year.
Beyond that, we've spoken about some of the timing differences around cash, but there's nothing else.
And then the only other one I would flag is that whilst we haven't given the time of the GBP145 million of costs that the Booker integration has been identified, that we would be treating as an exceptional.
And if that comes through exactly as it is, that would be GBP145 million as well.
But the timing of that we haven't fully put through.
And because, as I've said earlier, the costs there are getting product identified and getting a small element of central synergies.
If there are costs, there will be more within the distribution costs of the synergies.
And that will be not necessarily immediately incurred, I wouldn't have thought, because we're going to take time.
Not only are we taking Booker into our business; but one of the big changes which we spoke about at our Q4 trading was the impact of Palmer & Harvey on our distribution network, which was something which we had to take into account as we went through Q4.
And, indeed, is a bit of a [non-cost] even in the current year because of just the fact is Booker -- Palmer & Harvey volumes are now moving through our distribution network as well.
So it's more complex than originally thought, the distribution network; but those costs would be exceptional if -- as and when they are incurred.
Okay, thanks.
And just coming back on the pension deficit contribution, because in the retail cash flow in this year's report, the pension deficit is actually not down as an exceptional.
It's down before that line, basically.
So, is that right?
Sorry, I might -- I get slightly -- I get slightly confused sometimes between what is in and out of [for rent].
But I do think that that GBP9 million is for the pension cost.
Right, okay.
And then because just the numbers -- backing out the other numbers in the GBP9 billion, it implies GBP3.6 billion cash from operations this year.
Is that reasonable?
Or are you -- given you are a bit ahead -- get a bit ahead maybe on where you were thinking on EBIT, that you're maybe a bit ahead in terms of that GBP9 billion target?
So we're getting into a lot of detail which I think would be not necessarily appropriate.
But what I can say is that in terms of the [other] presentation today, what the -- what we spoke about in terms of those targets is that we're -- and that GBP9 billion target, we are well on track for it.
And that is something which both Dave and I spoke about.
So the maths follows.
And we showed a graph which -- on page 24 of the main deck, where we've generated cumulatively GBP5.6 billion, with GBP9 billion as the target.
So that's a GBP3.4 billion number which [you've took] the maths on it.
But the make-up and how we're going to get there is -- just really follows from whatever model you're using.
But it is difficult to be comment more precisely on it.
Okay.
No, that's great.
Thanks, cheers.
I'm afraid that that is all the time we have for questions today.
Alan, can I please pass it back to you for any closing comments?
