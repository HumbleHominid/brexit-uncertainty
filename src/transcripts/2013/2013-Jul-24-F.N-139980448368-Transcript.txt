Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Great day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second-quarter Ford Motor Company earnings conference call. My name is Katina and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards the end of the presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
George Sharp,  Ford Motor Company - Executive Director IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Katina, and good morning. Welcome to everyone joining us today either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team I would like to thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning so we can provide you with additional details of our second-quarter 2013 financial results.
Presenting today are Alan Mulally, President and CEO of Ford Motor, and Bob Shanks, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Mark Fields, Chief Operating Officer; Stuart Rowley, Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO.

Alan Mulally,  Ford Motor Company - President, CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, George, and good morning. We are pleased to review our second-quarter performance and the progress we continue to make in delivering our One Ford plan. Let's turn to the first slide, please.
Our One Ford plan, depicted here, remains the foundation for everything we do. Across the Ford enterprise we continue to aggressively restructure the business to operate profitably at the current demand and changing model mix; accelerate development of new products our customers want and value; finance our plan and continually improve our balance sheet; and work together effectively as one team, leveraging our global assets. Our goal is to serve customers in all markets with a full family of best-in-class vehicles -- small, medium and large, cars, utilities and trucks -- delivering profitable growth for all.
No place is this better represented than in China, where execution of the One Ford plan is well underway, with growing evidence of our success demonstrated in our results. As shown here on slide 2, our product portfolio is rapidly expanding in China. With five new segment launches in 2013 we are nearly doubling our lineup by year-end, and we continue to freshen our showrooms with three all-new or refreshed products.
Our dealer network in China is also expanding to serve our customers. We are on track to grow from about 600 dealer outlets at the end of 2012 to more than 900 by 2015.
Strong sales of our new products drove significant market share improvements in China, setting a record quarterly market share of 4.3% in the second quarter, in fact, our market share in China improved 7/10 of a percentage point from the first quarter and was up 1.5 percentage points from the same period last year.
To meet the growing demand for Ford vehicles in China, Changan Ford, one of our joint ventures, opened a new engine plant last month in Chongqing, more than doubling Changan Ford's annual engine capacity. The plant initially will produce the award-winning 1.0-liter EcoBoost engine, with our turbocharged direct injection 3-cylinder engine, recently named International Engine of the Year for the second year running, as well as a 1.5-liter naturally aspirated 4-cylinder engine.
Also in June JMC, another of our joint ventures, opened a new commercial vehicle assembly plant in Nanchang. This new, highly flexible production facility more than doubles JMC's annual capacity.
We also announced plans to bring two new global products to JMC, an all-new Ford commercial vehicle and an all-new Ford SUV. With the launch of these products, Ford will have a full portfolio of vehicles in China, delivering on our plan to introduce 15 new vehicles in China by 2015.
Let's now turn from the exciting progress we are making in China to our second-quarter results. We'll start on slide 3 with a summary of our accomplishments.
The Company had an outstanding second quarter, earning operating profit of $2.6 billion, our sixteenth consecutive profitable quarter. Automotive operating-related cash flow was very strong at $3.3 billion; and quarterly end liquidity exceeded $37 billion.
The top line showed double-digit percentage gains in year-over-year growth in both wholesale volume and total Company revenue, supported by market share gains in all regions around the world. Among our business units, both North America and Asia Pacific had record results.
In North America, we had the highest second quarter and first-half pretax results. And in Asia Pacific and Africa, we achieved our best pretax profit of any quarter.
Ford Credit once again delivered solid performance, and South America return to profitability. Europe incurred a loss, but it was improved compared with both a year ago and the first quarter, as we continue to execute our transformation plan leading to profitability by mid-decade.
Total Automotive operating margin at 6.4% improved 1.5 percentage points from 2012, with all regions contributing to our strong performance.
Today, we are improving our full-year Company financial guidance. We now expect total Company pretax profit to be about equal to or higher than 2012, and Automotive operating margin to be about equal to 2012. We also now expect Automotive operating-related cash flow to be substantially higher than last year.
Before turning to the financial details let's recap several other noteworthy achievements from the second quarter.
As shown on slide 4, we launched a number of products around the globe including the refreshed Fiesta in the US, Brazil, and Argentina; the Tourneo Custom in Russia; the Fiesta ST in South Africa and China; the EcoSport in India; and the 1.5-liter EcoBoost boost in Asia Pacific Africa. In Russia, we started full production of Explorer at our Elabuga Assembly Plant. At the Shanghai Motor Show we introduced the Escort Concept, indicating our future direction to meet the preferences of Chinese customers.
We announced investment in two new engine plants, one in China at JMC and another in Russia at our FordSollers joint venture. In Australia we announced a transformation of our business with plans to discontinue domestic manufacturing in 2016 and serve our customers with an exciting lineup of products from around the Ford world.
Meanwhile, in the US we celebrated the sale of more hybrid vehicles in the first five months of the year than we had sold previously in any full year. Finally, in North America we announced the addition of over 2,000 jobs in Kansas City to support higher F-Series demand and launch of the Ford Transit. This addition, along with 1,400 jobs to be added at our Flat Rock Assembly Plant, enable an increase in straight-time capacity of 200,000 units annually to meet demand. We are also announcing the reduced summer shutdown throughout North America.
Bob Shanks will now take us through the details of our financial performance in the quarter. Bob?

Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Alan, and good morning everyone. I am very pleased to be able to share our second-quarter results with you today.
Second-quarter wholesale volume was 1.7 million units, up 231,000 units or 16% from a year ago. And revenue at $38.1 billion was up $4.8 billion, or 15%.
Pretax profit was $2.6 billion, excluding special items, $726 million higher than a year ago. And our after-tax earnings per share at $0.45 were $0.15 higher.
Net income attributable to Ford, including unfavorable pretax special items of $736 million, was $1.2 billion, $193 million higher than a year ago. Earnings were $0.30 a share, up $0.04.
Special items in the second quarter included $442 million for separation-related actions, primarily in Europe, and $294 million associated with our US salaried retiree voluntary lump-sum payout program. You can find additional detail on these special items in Appendix 3.
Automotive operating-related cash flow was $3.3 billion, marking the thirteenth consecutive quarter of positive performance. Automotive gross cash improved to $25.7 billion, exceeding debt by $9.9 billion.
Our second-quarter operating effective tax rate, which isn't shown, was 32%. Consistent with prior guidance, we continue to expect our full-year operating effective tax rate to be similar to 2012, which was 32%.
In the first half, vehicle wholesales and revenue increased by about 13% from a year ago, and first-half pretax operating profit, excluding special items, was $4.7 billion, a $579 million improvement. Net income was $2.8 billion, $408 million higher than a year ago.
As shown on slide 6, both of our sectors, Automotive and Financial Services, contributed to the total Company's second-quarter pretax profit of $2.6 billion. And as shown in the memo below the chart, profit improved $726 million from a year ago, driven primarily by the Automotive sector. Compared with first-quarter 2013, total Company pretax profit improved $409 million, reflecting higher Automotive profit.
The key market factors and financial metrics for our total Automotive business are shown on slide 7. The strong Automotive performance reflects continued outstanding performance in North America; recovery in South America from the exchange-driven loss in the first quarter; great progress in Europe in continuing to deliver our transformation plan; and as noted, the best-ever quarterly profit in Asia Pacific Africa.
As already mentioned, total Automotive second-quarter wholesale volume and revenue were both up strongly from a year ago. The higher volume reflects improved market share in all regions and higher industry volume in all regions except Europe, as well as lower dealer stock reductions this year compared with a year ago. The growth in revenue reflects higher volume in all regions and net pricing gains everywhere except Europe, offset partially by unfavorable exchange in all regions.
Automotive pretax profit was $2.1 billion, up $722 million from a year ago, more than explained by favorable market factors -- and that is volume, mix, and net pricing. Operating margin at 6.4% was 1.5 percentage points higher, reflecting mainly favorable market factors.
As shown in the memo below the chart, first-half volume and revenue were both 13% higher than a year ago. And total Automotive first-half pretax profit at $3.7 billion and operating margin at 5.8% also were both higher.
The $700 million increase in total Automotive second-quarter pretax profit, compared with 2012, is explained by the causal factors shown on slide 8. The improvement reflects favorable market factors across all regions, offset partially by higher cost and unfavorable exchange, primarily in South America.
The cost increases mainly reflect investments in higher volume, growth, and new products for this year and the future, as well as restructuring-related cost in Europe and higher pension and OPEB expense in North America and Europe. As shown in the memo, pretax profit was $0.5 billion higher than first quarter, more than explained by favorable volume and mix and exchange. You can find more details on the quarter-to-quarter change in Appendix 8.
Our second-quarter pretax results for each of our Automotive operations, as well as Other Automotive are shown on slide 9. All regions were profitable except Europe, and they all improved compared with a year ago. In addition, the regions outside North America achieved the best combined result since second-quarter 2011.
Other Automotive reflects net interest expense, offset partially by a favorable fair market value adjustment on our investment in Mazda. For the full year, we now expect Automotive net interest expense to total about $800 million to $850 million. This is up from our prior guidance of $750 million to $800 million, primarily due to the impact of rising interest rates on the market value of our cash investments portfolio.
Now we will look at each of the regions within the Automotive sector, starting on slide 10 with North America. North America continued to perform very well, achieving a pretax profit of $2 billion or more and an operating margin of 10% or more for the fifth time out of the last six quarters.
In the second quarter, this reflects improving industry sales and a healthy full-size pickup segment; our strong product lineup; US market share growth, including strong growth in the East and West Coast markets; continued discipline in matching production to real demand; and a lean cost structure, even as we invest more in product and capacity for future growth.
As you can see in the first two graphs on the left, North America grew strongly in the second quarter, with wholesale volume and revenue each 14% higher than a year ago. The higher volume drove the revenue increase. The volume improvement mainly reflects higher US industry sales, increasing from a SAAR of 14.5 million to 15.7 million units, and higher US market share.
North America pretax profit was $2.3 billion, $319 million higher than a year ago; and operating margin at 10.4% also was higher. Favorable market factors more than account for the improvement in both metrics.
As shown in the memo below the chart, North America first-half pretax profit was $4.7 billion, a first-half record; and operating margin was 10.7%, about the same as a year ago. Volume and revenue were both about 16% higher than the same period a year ago.
On slide 11, we show in more detail the causal factors that drove the $300 million improvement in North America's second-quarter pretax profit. As mentioned, the improvement was driven by favorable market factors, offset partially by higher costs, including investment in new products and growth. As shown in the memo, pretax profit decreased by $100 million compared with first quarter, more than explained by higher costs.
Ford's US market share trends are shown on slide 12. Total US market share increased in the second quarter compared with last year and the prior quarter. Retail share of the retail industry also improved from the year ago, but was down from the prior quarter.
Starting on the left, our total market share was 16.5%, up 9/10 of a percentage point from the same period last year, reflecting robust F-Series sales and strong sales of the all-new C-MAX and Escape. Our share was up 6/10 of a percentage point from first-quarter 2013, reflecting stronger demand for small cars and E-Series vans from our fleet customers and higher retail sales of Lincoln MKZ and Escape.
As shown on the right, our retail market share of the retail industry was 13.7%, up 9/10 of a percentage point from last year, reflecting increases in F-Series, small cars, Escape, and MKZ. This includes favorable market segmentation for full-size pickups and midsize premium cars.
Our retail market share declined from first quarter, reflecting primarily lower dealer inventory of some products including Fusion and Explorer. We expect to address these constraints in the second half with the launch of Fusion at our Flat Rock Assembly Plant and an increase in Explorer capacity at our Chicago facility.
Now turning to our full-year guidance for North America, it remains unchanged. We continue to expect higher pretax profit compared with last year and an operating margin of about 10%.
Let's turn now to slide 13 and talk about South America. In South America, we are continuing to execute our strategy of expanding our product lineup while progressively replacing legacy products with global One Ford offerings. Customer response to the new Ranger pickup has been strong, while the all new EcoSport and Fusion are segment leaders. The recently refreshed Fiesta is also off to a strong start.
In the second quarter, wholesale volume and revenue increased from a year ago by 24% and 28%, respectively. The higher volume reflects favorable changes in dealer stocks, higher industry sales which increased from a SAAR of 5.3 million to 5.8 million units, and higher market share.
The market share increase from 9.4% to 9.6% was more than explained by strong sales of EcoSport. South America's growth in revenue was driven mainly by higher volume from new products and net pricing gains, offset partially by unfavorable exchange.
Pretax profit was $151 million, and the operating margin was 5%. The year-over-year improvement in both metrics is more than explained by favorable volume and mix and net pricing gains.
As shown in the memo below the chart, South America first-half loss was $67 million, which is more than explained by the impact of the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar in the first quarter. Volume and revenue were higher than last year.
On slide 14 we show more detail behind the $146 million increase in South America's second-quarter pretax results. As mentioned, our new products are gaining momentum and contributed to favorable mix and higher net pricing in the second quarter. Higher costs and unfavorable exchange were partial offsets.
As shown in the memo, pretax results were $369 million better than first quarter, explained primarily by favorable market factors and exchange, offset partially by higher costs. Our full-year guidance for South America remains unchanged. We continue to expect results to be about breakeven in an environment that remains challenging across the continent.
Let's turn now to Europe beginning on slide 15. As we will discuss in more detail shortly, Europe is well on track in executing their transformation plan, focused on product, brand, and cost.
In the second quarter, Europe's wholesale volume and revenue each improved about 8% from a year ago. The volume increase primarily reflects a non-repeat of dealer stock reductions incurred in 2012 and higher market share. Lower industry volume was a partial offset.
The SAAR declined from 14.4 million units a year ago to 13.6 million units this year. Europe's market share improved 5/10 of a percentage point from 7.6% to 8.1%, more than explained by higher share of the retail market. The increase in Europe's revenue mainly reflects the higher volume.
The pretax loss for Europe was $348 million and the operating margin was a negative 4.6%, both improved from a year ago despite the lower industry and the restructuring costs associated with our transformation plan. As shown in the memo below the chart, Europe's first-half loss was $810 million and operating margin was negative 5.7%, both worse than a year ago, more than explained by $291 million of restructuring costs. Volume and revenue were about equal compared with last year.
Slide 16 shows more detail of the causal factors that drove the $56 million improvement in Europe's second-quarter pretax results from the year ago. The improvement is more than explained by favorable volume and mix, offset partially by higher structural cost, mainly accelerated depreciation and a nonrecurring write-off related to facilities we plan to close.
The memo on the right side of the slide shows the restructuring-related costs that are included in our operating results. Personnel separation-related costs, which were significant this quarter, are captured in special items. As shown in the memo below the chart, pretax results improved $114 million compared with first quarter, mainly due to favorable volume and mix.
Slide 17, which is new this quarter, shows total market share for the 19 Europe markets we track, as well as passenger car retail market share of the retail industry for the five major European markets. And these five major European markets represent about 75% of the 19 markets.
Starting on the left, our total market share was 8.1%, up 5/10 of a percentage point from the same period last year, more than explained by strong sales of the all new B-MAX and improvements by Transit, Kuga, and Ranger. The share also was up 4/10 of a percentage point from first quarter.
A key element of our European transformation plan is to focus on retail sales and to reduce reliance on short-cycle rental and dealer self-registration units. This is key to our brand health, residual values, and margins.
As shown in the right-hand chart, our strategy is working. Our share of the retail segment of the five major European markets grew to 8.3% in the first quarter and 8.4% in the second quarter, nearly 2 percentage points better than the same period last year.
This improvement has been underpinned by the strong retail performance of our all-new B-MAX and Fiesta as well as retail share gains for Focus. Consistent with our strategy, dealer stock days supply of new vehicles at the end of the second quarter have been reduced in line with our plan, and stock of dealer self-registered vehicles have been reduced by about two-thirds compared with the prior year. Going into the third quarter, our retail order banks are very healthy at about 50% higher than prior year in a down market.
As slide 18 shows we continue to progress in delivering our European transformation plan. Our product acceleration remains on track, with the introduction now of five new passenger and two new commercial vehicles through June.
Due in part to the strength of our new products, as already noted, our retail share improved sharply in the second quarter; and our fleet share also improved 4/10 of a percentage point. Internal data also suggest we are improving quality and the perception of the Ford brand in the region as well.
We continue to make progress on cost, too, including our plan to close three facilities and relocate production for a more efficient manufacturing footprint. Our Southhampton Assembly Plant and Dagenham Stamping and Tooling operations will close at the end of this week, and we have completed the consultation process with the unions at our Genk, Belgium, plant which is scheduled to close at the end of next year.
As mentioned earlier, special items in the second quarter -- shown in Appendix 3 -- include $442 million for worldwide separation-related actions, of which $419 million was related to separation costs for personnel at the Genk and UK facilities, as part of our transformation plan. The total of these separation cost is estimated at about $1.2 billion, all of which we expect to incur by year-end 2014, with about $800 million to be recognized this year including the $400 million I just mentioned for the second quarter.
Now in terms of our full-year guidance for Europe, we now expect our loss to be about the same as a year ago or about $1.8 billion. This compares to our prior guidance of a loss of about $2 billion. While the outlook for the business environment in Europe continues to be uncertain, data trends suggest that economic and industry conditions may have begun to stabilize.
Let's now turn to Asia Pacific Africa on slide 19. Our strategy in Asia Pacific Africa is straightforward -- to aggressively grow with an expanding portfolio of global One Ford products tailored for the region, with manufacturing hubs in China, in India, and in ASEAN. Implementation of the strategy is clearly gaining momentum.
As shown on the left, second-quarter wholesale volume was up 27% from a year ago; and net revenue, which excludes our China joint ventures, grew 35%. The higher volume reflects mainly higher market share as well stronger industry sales, which increased from a SAAR of 33.4 million units to 35.4 million. Unfavorable changes in dealer stocks were a partial offset.
Second-quarter market share in the region was 3.6%, 1 full percentage point higher than a year ago and a quarterly record. The 38% improvement was driven by China, which isn't shown, where our market share improved, as Alan mentioned, by 1.5 percentage points to a quarterly record of 4.3%, reflecting mainly strong sales of the new Focus, Kuga, and EcoSport.
Asia Pacific Africa's higher revenue primarily reflects favorable volume and mix. Pretax profit at $177 million was a new quarter record, and operating margin was 5.8%, both improved from last year due to favorable market factors. This was also the region's fourth consecutive quarterly profit.
As shown in the memo below the chart, Asia Pacific Africa first-half profit was $183 million with an operating margin of 3.2 percentage points -- 3.2%, rather, both higher than a year ago. Volume and revenue also increased.
The $243 million improvement from a year ago in Asia Pacific Africa's second-quarter pretax results is explained by causal factor on slide 20. As we have seen in past quarters, top-line related factors were favorable, offset partially by higher cost as we continue to invest for future growth, as well as unfavorable exchange. We also benefited from higher royalties, parts and accessories profits, as well as an insurance recovery -- all included in Other.
As shown in the memo, Asia Pacific Africa pretax results were $171 million higher than first-quarter 2013, more than explained by favorable volume and mix. Given the strong first-half performance and the momentum demonstrated by our business in the region, we now expect Asia Pacific Africa to be profitable for the full year.
Turning now to Ford Credit, slide 21 shows the $16 million increase in second-quarter pretax results compared with a year ago by causal factor. The results are more than explained by higher receivables and financing margin, offset partially by lower credit loss reserve reductions.
As shown in the memo, Ford Credit's pretax results decreased by $53 million compared with first quarter due to unfavorable mark-to-market on the derivative portfolio and seasonal insurance losses. Ford Credit remains key to our global growth strategy, providing world-class dealer and customer financial services, maintaining a strong balance sheet of producing solid profits and distributions.
For the full year, Ford Credit continues to expect pretax profits to be about the same as last year and distributions to the Parent of about $200 million. Ford Credit now expects year-end managed receivables to range between $97 billion and $102 billion, which is within our prior range of $95 billion to $105 billion.
Next on slide 22 is our Automotive gross cash and operating-related cash flow. As you can see here, Automotive gross cash at the end of the quarter was $25.7 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion from the end of the first quarter. Automotive operating-related cash flow was $3.3 billion driven primarily by Automotive profits of $2.1 billion and favorable timing differences of $1.2 billion.
During the quarter, we contributed $1 billion to our worldwide funded pension plans, which included about $800 million of discretionary payments to our US funded plans, in line with our long-term pension derisking strategy. Dividends paid in the quarter totaled about $400 million; and we continued our compensation-related share repurchase program.
In the first half, our operating related cash flow was $4 billion and gross cash improved $1.4 billion. We now expect Automotive operating-related cash flow to be substantially higher than it was in 2012, which compares to our prior guidance of simply higher, which was $3.4 billion in 2012.
Now I'll summarize our Automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of the quarter, which is captured on slide 23. Automotive debt at the end of the quarter totaled $15.8 billion, which was $200 million lower than first quarter.
In April we took advantage of favorable market conditions by increasing our revolving credit facility from $9.3 billion to $10.7 billion and extending its maturity from November 2015 to November 2017. We ended the quarter with net cash of $9.9 billion and liquidity of $37.1 million.
We would now like to provide on slide 24 a special update on our pension derisking strategy. In the first half, we contributed $2.8 billion to our global funded pension plans, including $2 billion in discretionary contributions to our US plans. For the full year, we continue to expect contributions of $5 billion to our global funded plans, including about $3.4 billion in discretionary contributions.
In the second quarter, we settled $1.5 billion of obligations related to the US salaried retiree voluntary lump-sum program, with $2.7 billion settled since the inception of the program last year. As a result of the second-quarter settlement, we recognized a special item charge of $294 million reflecting the acceleration of unrecognized losses in the plan. The lump-sum program now is about 60% complete based on obligations and concludes by year end.
Also we have continued to progressively improve the mix of fixed-income assets to our plans' portfolios, with the objective of reducing funded status volatility. As a result of the strategic actions we have been taking, along with recent increases in discount rates, the funded status of our global funded pension plans significantly improved as of June 30 compared with the end of last year. As usual, we will provide a full update at the end of the year.
Now with that I would like to turn it back to Alan, who will take us through our outlook for the business environment as well as an update of our 2013 planning assumptions and key metrics.

Alan Mulally,  Ford Motor Company - President, CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Bob. Summarized on slide 25 is our view of the business environment going forward. Overall, our outlook has not changed substantially.
We project 2013 global GDP growth to be at the lower end of the 2% to 3% range. Global industry sales are projected at the higher end of an 80 million to 85 million unit range.
US economic growth is expected to be in a 2% to 2.5% range, with industry sales supported by continuing improvement in the housing sector and replacement demand as a result of the older age of vehicles on the road. In South America, recent developments in Brazil add uncertainty to the near-term outlook, while in Argentina and Venezuela there are escalated risks, as both economies are weak with an unclear economic policy direction.
The euro area is in recession, but incoming data suggest that economic and industry conditions may have begun to stabilize. Recent policy decisions such as the European Central Bank's rate cut and the European Union's extension of deficit targets for some markets are positive steps.
In Asia Pacific and Africa, economic indicators point towards growth in the 7% to 8% range in China this year. Growth in India, on the other hand, is below its full potential due partially to high inflation and interest rates.
Overall, despite challenges, we expect global growth to continue for 2013.
Our guidance for 2013 is detailed here on slide 26.
We now expect full-year industry volume to range from 15.5 million to 16 million units in the US; Europe to be at the higher end of 13 million to 13.5 million unit range; and China to range from 20.5 million to 21.5 million units. We project our full-year market share to increase over 2012 in the US and China and to be about equal to last year in Europe, but we expect our retail share of the retail market in Europe to improve.
Our total Company second-quarter production volume, shown in Appendix 5, was about 1.7 million units, 218,000 units higher than a year ago, reflecting higher volumes in all regions. We expect total Company third-quarter production volume to be about 1.6 million units, up 195,000 units from a year ago, also reflecting higher volumes in all regions.
The outlook for quality is now mixed, as we expect performance in North America, South America, and Asia Pacific to be about the same as last year, but Europe to be better.
In terms of our financial performance we now expect total Company pretax profit to be about equal or higher than 2012; Automotive operating margin to be about equal to 2012; and Automotive operating-related cash flow to be substantially higher than 2012, including capital spending of about $7 billion to support our industry-leading product refresh rates, expansion of our portfolio in an absolute sense and across the regions, and capacity actions.
Overall, 2013 is proving to be another strong year for the Ford Motor Company as we continue to work towards our mid-decade outlook.
In closing, our One Ford plan is built on a compelling vision, comprehensive strategy, and relentless implementation. As the results we have announced today make clear, our One Ford plan continues to deliver profitable growth around the world, and we are absolutely focused on building great products, creating a stronger business, and continue to contribute to a better world.
We achieved outstanding results in the second quarter and we continue to expect strong results for the full year. This includes -- continued strength from North America; delivery of global products into South America for product-led growth for the remainder of the year, even as we work to adjust to an uncertain economic environment in the region; continued successful execution of our transformation plan for Europe, for which many proof points are evident and which is proceeding as planned as we work to return to profitability by mid-decade; strong investment for the long-term success in Asia Pacific and Africa, which is already beginning, being reflected in improved revenue, market share, and financial results. And, consistent performance from our valued Ford Credit operations, which delivers world-class customer service and solid bottom-line results.
Now we would be delighted to take your questions. George?

    Great, thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a great quarter. Any color on Asia Pacific results? Is there anything unique in the quarter that is not sustainable?
I know, I think in your Investor Day a couple years ago you highlighted that Asia Pacific would be a meaningful contributor. Seems to be evidence for that; but is there anything we should think about as it proceeds through the year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Mulally,  Ford Motor Company - President, CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sure. Bob?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Colin, I think the only thing that I would just note in the results, there was an insurance recovery; but it was relatively minor. I think it was around $30 million, if you will. So even if you put that to the side, $150 million profit or so, very, very strong for us.
So I think what you are seeing is the strong top-line performance that we have seen for quite some time is now starting to show up -- which we knew it would -- on the bottom line. And as we look ahead at the balance of the year and at the very, very strong market reaction to all the new products, we have got more coming in the second half of the year. That is what is giving us the confidence, built on the momentum that we've established in the first quarter, to raise our guidance on Asia Pacific.
So we feel very good about it and it is a quality result through and through.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Langan,  UBS - Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Then on South America, you highlighted in your closing comments that Brazil has some uncertainty and there is risk in Argentina and Venezuela. And it does seem like even within the quarter foreign currency kept working against you. What gives you confidence to maintain your guidance for that region?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, a couple of things. One is the first half was largely affected by the one-time devaluation of the Bolivar. That was nearly $200 million, so that is what is pushing us into the loss cumulatively in the first half. And we don't expect the Venezuelan government to do anything on that front in the second half of the year.
So we think that was, if you will, a one-time, or at least from the perspective of a calendar year. So if you put that to the side, we would have been at a low level but we would have been at a run rate that was profitable in the half.
We think that will continue into the second half. The strong market reaction that we are seeing to the Ranger and to the EcoSport will continue.
It is really giving us great performance in terms of market share growth. It is giving us favorable mix, because the margins on these products are very healthy. And we have got the all new Focus coming in the second half of the year, which will build on that.
So putting aside some anomalous events that occur, we think that probably will give us at least a breakeven result. I should have mentioned also we have introduced the refreshed Fiesta, which is also doing very, very well in the marketplace, so we feel pretty good about where we are right now. And we think breakeven is the appropriate call at this point in time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Colin Langan,  UBS - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, all right. Thank you very much.

Patrick Archambault,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi. Yes, good morning and congrats also on the quarter. Just wanted to follow up on that Latin America question actually. Yes, it does seem in fact that the guidance implies a sequential pretty big drop down; right? I think it was 150 this quarter -- and haven't done the fine-tuning, but it would be substantially below that to get breakeven on a quarterly basis in the second half.
Can you tell us a little bit more? Obviously you've got a lot going on there in terms of product, but I guess maybe the production outlook is a little bit different given some of the uncertainty you are facing.
Are you actually taking schedules down a little bit? A little bit more color on that sequential path.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. No, we think -- if you just step back for a minute, Patrick, and look at the region, clearly you are looking at the headlines of Brazil and so there is some uncertainty in terms of what that will all mean. Clearly we are seeing the GDP growth of Brazil soften, and it is running at well below what should be a much stronger run rate.
In the case of Venezuela, Venezuela is Venezuela; and it presents its unique challenges every day, every quarter. And when you look at Argentina it is going through one of its cyclical swoons, and that presents challenges as well.
So I understand your point. We do think that we will be profitable, obviously, in the second half; and we will work hard to make it better. But that is just our best call at this time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patrick Archambault,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Then if I can ask one on Europe, maybe a two-part question there. Out of the $1.8 billion loss that you're forecasting for this year, can you remind us of how much of that is really one-time, related to accelerated depreciation and the like? How much of that comes out once you close -- once you do remove Dagenham and Southhampton?
And then the second part to that question is also -- can you tell us a little bit more about the transition costs now that you have got permission to close Genk? I guess you really start the efforts to ramp up at Valencia. How big of a nut is that in terms of a cost headwind? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I will just give you an answer to the first, and then maybe Mark could give you a perspective on what we are doing in terms of the footprint reconfiguration. We think that the impact this year on our restructuring costs will be $400 million or $500 million.
And you can see what we have here in the quarter, which included a one-time writeoff of some assets related largely to Genk. So we think -- and that is what we have been saying. We think we are on track to that and now moving ahead with the reconfiguration.
Since -- in fact, the plants in the UK close this week and we have gotten past the information and consultation process in Belgium and now moving towards closure at the end of '14. But Mark can tell you a bit more, give you some color in terms of how we are moving forward on that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks, Bob. Well, as you know, we are going to -- we have mentioned before that as we look at the transformation plan in Europe that our structural costs over time will actually increase. And that is to support our growth strategy.
As part of that, will be the cost associated with moving products around, as you mentioned, down to Valencia as well as Saarlouis to make sure that we can continue to produce those products in a more efficient footprint. So we will report out on that as we go forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rod Lache, Deutsche Bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rod Lache,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning, everybody. Congratulations. Just one quick thing, just to follow up on that last question, what should we be thinking with respect to the accelerated D&A in Europe next year? Does that fall off?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, we are not going to provide any guidance to next year. But we will continue to have the restructuring. The writeoff of the restructuring related to Genk will go all the way through the closure of the facility, and that will be at the end of the year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rod Lache,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Now UK will be finished with the closure of the facilities. But that was by far the smaller of the effects that were included in the restructuring costs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rod Lache,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Just jumping over to Asia, it is pretty significant if you annualize the number from the quarter. It sounds like, just based on the SAAR expectations, that maybe you are expecting a little bit of moderation in the back half versus what we have seen in the first half. Because your full-year outlook is a bit below -- at least the midpoint of your full-year outlook is a bit below what we did in the first half.
Can you just talk about what you are seeing in that market? Do you have any thoughts with respect to maybe different GDP scenarios and what that would do to demand?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, when we look at China, it is obviously the biggest market in the region. Our growth prospects for China, I think as Alan mentioned, are sort of 7% to 8%.
It is softening, although at a very high level, which is probably healthy for the long-term prospects for the economy. But we do see it softening a bit from where it had been in recent years.
Our call for the industry is -- we have tightened the range a bit to 20.5 million to 21.5 million units in terms of a SAAR. So I think we feel pretty comfortable about that right now. It could be towards the higher end, but we think that is looking good.
India is the other big market there and that one again we are seeing a little bit of soft unit growth, although still at a pretty good rate, but under what it could perform. And we are seeing, as a result of high interest rates and inflation, impacts on the GDP and also on the industry there, too. So it has been softening a bit, but it's still large.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The only thing I would add to what Bob mentioned, first, to put this into perspective, the China market is going to be up significantly year-over-year when you look at our ranges, over 10%. But one thing we are watching, Rod, very closely is in June the OEMs have a practice to pay midyear bonuses based on wholesales. So potentially what we saw is a little bit of spike up in the month of June; we will see how July plays out. So we are factoring that into our call.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rod Lache,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thanks. Just lastly, a little bit of clarification on North America. You did $1 billion of better earnings from volume on about a 104,000 unit increase in the wholesales, which is like $9,600 a unit, which is obviously higher than what we have seen historically.
Maybe you could just clarify what you are thinking in terms of pricing. It looks quite good. We are seeing some of your competitors becoming a little bit more aggressive in small and mid cars. But your inventories are constrained, so how should we be thinking about the outlook there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, we have said for the Company itself we're going to have positive pricing globally for the year on a year-over-year basis, and we think that is the case in North America. Everyone is still performing and acting in a rather disciplined way.
You are going to see some players each month, depending upon the vehicle line and what they have got going on, doing something. But in general I think the discipline we have seen for quite some time is still holding up.
And of course associated with the new products that we introduce, we always add equipment and generally have been able to price for that. So that is one of the things that's -- in fact, that is exactly what is driving our pricing is new equipment. If you took the equipment out, we probably wouldn't be in positive territory.
But we think in total that we will see positive pricing continue for the full year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rod Lache,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And the volume effect, is there anything unusual there, the $9,600?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, nothing unusual. As you can see on slide 11, it is just driven by the industry, the share, less of a -- we have had a small change in stocks; it is not really material. A bit of adverse mix actually, which is a good thing. It is just the huge success that we have seen in the Super segments that we have talked about.
F-Series still doing very, very well. It is just that the Super segment products are doing even better and particularly on the East and West Coast. So nothing unusual.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rod Lache,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [27]

    Okay. Thank you.

    John Murphy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Murphy,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just a first question on all the new hires. I am just curious how many of them are Tier 2 workers. Or are you still calling back Tier 1 workers?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    John, this is Mark. As we mentioned, the 2,000 workers that we are bringing back this year, between our Kansas City facility but also the other 1,400 at Flat Rock, the majority of it is the entry-level wage. We have redeployed a lot of our folks, but a lot of it is the entry-level wage, and we are planning on that accordingly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Murphy,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    What kind of limits do you have on those hires, as far as a percentage of your workforce? And where would you be once you are through this wave of hiring?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, when we had the contract back in 2011 I believe the limit was 20%. But we did have some exceptions to that -- our facility in Roseville as well as another facility. So it is about 20% and we're working on our way towards that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Murphy,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Then second question, Bob, just on the pensions on slide 24. You gave us a good update, but you talked about a material improvement.
As we look at this and where rates have gone and asset returns have gone and your contributions, it looks like in the US the $9.7 billion underfunded status is probably at this point more than cut in half. By the end of the year there might be a material step further.
What does material mean as far as you're improving? Is it at least half? I am just trying to understand the tea leaves here, because this is a pretty important topic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, it is very important; and we are very encouraged by the progress we are seeing. I think the way that I would think about it is, we have put $2.8 billion into our funds in the first half, $2 billion of which were discretionary in the US plans.
And then as you might recall from some of the other presentations that we have provided, if you look at a sensitivity, a 1-point change in US discount rates would impact US funded status by about $5 billion. And we did about 70, 80 basis points, I think, is the improvement that we are --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Murphy,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, that is extremely helpful. Then lastly, Alan, you have been very vocal about the weakness in the yen and your concern about that from a competitive standpoint. But in the US we haven't seen it show up in pricing or competition yet.
I am just curious. Are you seeing that in other regions? And how important a topic do you think this is to really stay on top of going forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Mulally,  Ford Motor Company - President, CEO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, clearly, John, it is really an important topic for not just Ford but everybody around the world, because it is just so important that the markets establish exchange rates and the valuation. To answer your question specifically, we are seeing some actions, primarily outside the United States. As Bob mentioned in his comments, there have been some pretty clear indications from some of our competitors' leaders about the importance of using that in their business going forward.
Now having said that, I think the work that is going on internationally, but especially associated with the US, associated with the TPP free trade agreement, is really, really important because so many people now really appreciate the importance of free trade agreements that have the markets establishing the currency.
So I think we are going to see more attention on that subject, and I think that is really positive because it is absolutely really important to free trade agreements going forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Murphy,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Lastly, just one follow-up to that, Alan. Are you seeing any change in the pricing strategy from some of your Japanese suppliers versus your North American suppliers in their are bidding levels are?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Mulally,  Ford Motor Company - President, CEO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, not substantially at this time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Murphy,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, great. Thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    John, before you run away, I probably wish it were $5 billion but apparently it is only $2 billion to $2.5 billion for 1 basis point of change. So it is still material.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Murphy,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I got very excited and was about to run away, but that's still pretty good.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, I'm very excited too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Murphy,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    But that's still pretty good. That's still a pretty good improvement. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I have dreams. I have dreams and aspirations. Apparently that one is not coming true.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Brian Johnson, Barclays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Johnson,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi, good morning. Just to follow up on the pension then a question on Europe, certainly we understand, because it is mechanical, the reduction in liabilities from discount rate. Yet at the same time part of your derisking strategy, as you flag, is to be in fixed income and maybe even move towards first income. A couple questions.
One, had you gone to a liability-driven investing strategy, where you're attempting to match the duration of those fixed-income assets to that of your liabilities, and whether or not, and if so did you pull back that duration to try to time the bond market?
And regardless of that, just where is the fixed-income part of your asset base performing? And what does that mean for the potential direction of the funding gap?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, we are not going to provide any specific performance measurements around the asset returns that we have seen so far, nor are we in terms of the specific number related to the funded status. But we have made really, really good progress in terms of moving towards the strategy of sort of an 80/20 fixed income versus growth asset mix.
As of the end of the half we were at 60%, so really making good progress to that objective. And as you said, Brian, it is to match better the assets and the obligations, so that when there are changes in discount rates and so forth we are able to reduce volatility. And that is exactly what we are trying to do, and we are on path to do so.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Johnson,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Doesn't that dilute some of the potential closing of the funding gap?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, because we are doing it progressively. We are doing it in line. As we get more and more funded, we're progressively improving the amount or increasing the amount of fixed assets.
So we are not moving too fast so that we can benefit from opportunities from growth assets. But that is part of the overall strategy. And, don't forget, as we do that we become increasingly less exposed as discount rates change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Johnson,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Then on Europe, can you comment a bit on the sequential pricing environment? It appeared to weaken quarter over quarter. Are you seeing your order books are very full, which would imply maybe less of a need for discounting?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, what we are seeing is on a sequential basis we were adverse in terms of net pricing. That was largely driven by the timing of some rental sales. We pulled back on the rental market, but we did have the timing of effect of some of those sales which affected the quarter.
And we also had some other sort of just timing issues, if you will, that impacted that. What we have seen is an increase in incentives at Ford in Europe; but it is much less than what our competitors have been doing. So again, it is part of the overall story of us pulling back from those unhealthy channels, enabling us to get more per unit in terms of what we are selling.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Johnson,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So were these the wholesale revenue booked upon return of a program car?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I don't know.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Johnson,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Or was it (multiple speakers)?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    

    I think it was just related more to the daily rentals and the timing. There were just some deliveries that occurred in the second quarter that drove that performance, along with some other (multiple speakers)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Johnson,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (multiple speakers) if it was deliveries or return of cars, so it sounds like (multiple speakers), okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, no, no, it was sales.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brian Johnson,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [59]

Adam Jonas,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For a minute I was thinking it was $5 billion for each 1 basis point; I was getting really excited there. But, wow (laughter).
So question on China. Can you give us a capacity utilization number in China, even if it is a rough one? Because given how much structural cost burden you're shouldering for the growth there versus your current level of production, it is tough to get a sense. Can you help us out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, Adam. This is Mark.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adam Jonas,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks, Mark.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Obviously, we don't give out specific numbers but as you can imagine we are running our facilities pretty flat out there and at the same time building new facilities. As you now, in Asia Pacific in total we have built about -- we have either built or are in the process of building 10 plants, and seven of those are in China and three that we just announced. So we have four more to go and we are using them flat out.
To give you a sense of what is going on in the marketplace, our biggest challenge right now is meeting demand. It is a true retail pull, not a wholesale push.
But the demand pull from the dealers is very strong. That strength is across the regions, across the multitiered cities.
What has also held is our full lineup of SUVs now, as customers are coming in for our wonderful new Kuga, they are seeing the Explorer, they are seeing our EcoSport. And as you can imagine, the sales as a percent availabilities are very high.
And it's having some residual other benefits as well. As you know, we are growing our dealer network there to support our growth in the Tier 2, 3, and 4, and 5 cities. So we are getting actually even better candidates for our dealers.
And it is also helping our recruitment efforts for our employees. So overall, we are running as fast as we can there, doing it with quality, and delivering those products to our customers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adam Jonas,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks, Mark. Appreciate that. Just a couple follow-ups. Any impact of Detroit bankruptcy that you wanted to highlight or dismiss?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, I think -- that is an interesting thing to look at. As you know, we all went through our own restructuring and it is a searing experience; it is something you never forget. It seems like it goes on forever.
But as you can see from the results that we have been announcing and that we were announcing in the past and that we are announcing today, when you work your way through it, when you come out the other end you are much healthier and it is just a much better situation.
We are confident that the government leaders of Detroit and the state will move forward and address the issues of the city. It is going to be healthy for Ford, healthy for suppliers, healthy for the state.
It is not having any direct impact on Ford, but we are fully supportive and wish everyone the best, and we will participate to the extent we can help. It is just going to be good when it is all said and done.
I think we are a good example of that ourselves. Didn't go through bankruptcy, but we went through a horrible restructuring in terms of the experience. So we know what it is like, and it is going to be good.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adam Jonas,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks for that. My last question. I wouldn't normally ask about a month's results, but given the model year changeover, so substantial for not just you but mainly -- for many of your competitors as well, any comment on how July is progressing in the United States? Thanks very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, I mean it looks like the SAAR is running at a very healthy rate again, maybe it is around 16 million units including medium-heavies. I wouldn't say anything about our own performance, but we will talk about that in detail as usual at the beginning of August.

    Thanks very much for taking the question. I have two. In your comments you describe cash flow as being substantially better for the year. Would that simply reflect the changes in the Automotive operating guidance, or is there more to that?
Additionally can you provide some color on the timing differences in cash flow? Suppose the charges have something to do with that, but are there any other issues like incentive accruals and such?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks, Matt, for the question. Well, in part the change in guidance simply reflects what is already in the bank. We have done $4 billion in the first half; we did $3.4 billion for the full year last year. So clearly we are going to do substantially better in 2013 than we did in 2012 and are acknowledging that.
When you look at the details of it, clearly the stronger profits are helping. We are seeing favorable changes in working capital. And then in the quarter in particular we had very strong timing differences, which is generally around marketing, warranty, our extended service programs, pension, compensation, those types of things where the difference between expense and cash are recognized in this category.
So, that is -- but I would just remind everyone, we had $0.8 billion negative in this category in the first quarter. So we have equalized that plus come out ahead by about $0.4 billion. So that is one of the contributors as well.
But it is generally happening everywhere. The only area we have got a negative, if you will, within the cash flow -- which is a positive for the business -- is the net spending because of the investments for products and capacity and growth in the future. That is obviously adversely affecting the cash flow.

    Okay. The second question is on North America. The results there have been quite strong. In the quarter you showed really nice volume improvement. Mix has been pretty good.
It has on a year-over-year basis been just mathematically negative for the last two quarters. Pricing has been positive, but the gains have been declining.
I guess as I think about the second half, my instinct would be that given the cadence of new products there is more volume, but also a negative mix of pricing in the second half. Is there any reason not to believe the pricing wouldn't be negative year-to-year in the second half?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, as I said for the full year, we are expecting our pricing to be favorable in North America as well as for the total Company. And when you look at the individual quarters, we will have to wait and see where we come out, but we think that given the strength of our products that we have got out there and the customer response to them, at least for the full year that we will be positive. And we will have to wait and see what the individual quarters bring.

    Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we would like to welcome questions from the media. (Operator Instructions) Craig Trudell, Bloomberg News.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Craig Trudell,  Bloomberg News - Media    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi, thanks. My question is related to the pension and the rising interest rate environment. You have said that you are seeing a material improvement on the underfunded status.
What sorts of things does that improvement free you up to do? Would you put more cash toward your products? Would you be able to boost the amount of cash you return to investors? What sorts of things would that free you up for?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks, Craig. I think there's two things that come to mind when you think about the improvement in the funded status. One is the credit rating agencies look at the underfunded status and consider that as debt when they are looking at our ratings in the metrics that they evaluate. So the improvement there is clearly a positive in terms of the strength of the balance sheet as viewed by the rating agencies and, frankly, as we look at ourselves. So that is a big positive.
In addition we have assumed -- as you know, our derisking strategy is to get our global funded plans fully funded by mid-decade. So we have assumed there would be a normalization over time of the discount rates, which means an increase because they have been at historic low levels.
So this is simply what we have assumed in terms of a glide path. It is getting us to the point where we will be able to have fully funded plans.
We won't have to allocate as much capital to pensions as we have the last couple of years and certainly this year. That will give us the ability to take the cash that we are generating and invest it in other parts of the business that can support further growth. And that is certainly what we have in mind.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Good morning, gentlemen. A question for you, Bob. I just want to make sure I did the math right.
The expectation for the lump sum payments by the end of 2014, is that $4.5 billion? I am assuming that if you're $2.7 billion right now and that is about 60% of the way, is that about the right way to think about it?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, we're not providing a specific number because it obviously depends on the remaining participants who have the individual right of selection and whether they want to participate or not. But directionally probably what you are saying is correct. But we are not actually providing specific guidance on that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vipal Monga,  The Wall Street Journal - Media    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Then just in terms of the take-up rate or the percentage of people, how has that met expectations that you might have had?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Again, that is something that we are not going to talk about till we are completely finished. The number of or the types of individuals who remain include term vested, so it is a different kind of group of employees that have yet to make a choice.
So we will have to wait and see, because again every person is different, probably every different category of employee or retiree is different. So we will have to wait and see. But we will give you all the details when we are all done.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vipal Monga,  The Wall Street Journal - Media    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Great. Just a last follow-up on that. Any consideration of doing things that, for example, Verizon and GM did, in terms of doing an annuitization as well, as you attempt to derisk the pensions?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, we have no plans to do that at this time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deepa Seetharaman,  Reuters - Media    [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hey, this is actually Deepa Seetharaman. I just have two quick questions.
In the second quarter you settled about $1.5 billion of the pension obligations related to the lump-sum program of $2.7 billion overall. Why was the amount so high in the second quarter?
Something special? Was this a particularly successful round? Why was more than half settled in this quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [90]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, it depends on the number of participants and the number of people that were involved in the second tranche of the program. So again as I said, Deepa, it's very individual. We haven't said how many people have been participating in any particular tranche.
We are now about halfway through, so I think I can tell you that. But it really depends upon the concentration of the offers, who they are, how many people, and so forth.
And it has been different, tranche by tranche. So I wouldn't read anything into that.
I think based on a previous question, I think it is probably reasonable to assume we are about 60% of the way through in terms of obligation. Directionally, you can probably figure out more or less where we will end up when it is all done.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Deepa Seetharaman,  Reuters - Media    [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Then you guys have talked about capacity constraints a lot in the first half of the year. Do you have any sense as to how much more capacity you would have needed in the first half to absorb all the demand for the Fusion, Explorer, and other vehicles in the US?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Fields,  Ford Motor Company - COO    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Clearly as we said we have -- we are getting a little tight on inventories on vehicles like Fusion, and as you know we are taking some actions around that. So really couldn't put an amount to it.
Did we would probably leave a few sales on the table? Yes, probably. But we are rectifying that as we go into the second half of the year as you know, as we put the third crew on at Kansas City for F-Series and then of course launching the Flat Rock Assembly Plant, which will bring on a whole 'nother tranche of Fusions to meet the surging customer demand that is out there. So we are in the process of addressing that.

    Hey, guys, I was just wondering if you could say -- provide any more color on where the market share came from in China. Did you -- do you feel like you were stealing customers away from -- was it the Japanese? Are they still losing market share because of some of the issues there?
Are you taking it from the domestic manufacturers? Where did you see it coming from?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [96]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, as you probably know, most of the buyers in China are still first-time buyers. So that is one of the great things about our investments there is we are going after first-time buyers. We don't have to steal them, if you will, which is really hard.
So first-time buyers, and it is coming from all the new products that we have launched. In this particular quarter it was the Escape, it was the Kuga. The Focus is still doing very, very well. The refreshed Fiesta, EcoSport -- I don't know if I've mentioned that.
But we just -- we are expanding the lineup so quickly and I think as Mark mentioned earlier -- or maybe Alan, I can't remember who said it -- SUVs or utilities are really popular now everywhere in the world, and China is no exception. So with the introduction of Explorer, EcoSport, and Kuga, which is Escape here, the market has really responded very, very strongly and driving the share.

Mike Ramsey,  The Wall Street Journal - Media    [98]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi, good morning. Alan, I was hoping you could answer this question, which is -- if you had to figure out one thing that is driving your strong revenue growth around the world, is it -- can you pin it to your global product plan, so that you are able to put out all these new products around the world at the same time? Is that the secret to how you can get 15% revenue growth in an environment where I don't think that most auto companies are anywhere close to that level of revenue growth?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alan Mulally,  Ford Motor Company - President, CEO    [99]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sure, Mike, and good morning to you. I think absolutely it is grounded in the foundation that we all put together nearly 7 years ago. And that was to serve all the customers around the world with a full family of best-in-class vehicles; and then, of course, clearly focus on the Ford brand and then Lincoln.
I think probably it is kind of like Jim Farley said -- I know you remember this well -- that you can't spell your reputation by telling people what you are going to do. So we really focus on developing world-class products in every market segment and let those then lead the brand.
And the response has been absolutely incredible. With every new product we have watched the favorable opinion, we watch the coverage and the brand itself of Ford itself. So I think it is a combination of these great products, a complete family of products, and also our ability to introduce those products very quickly. Because based on our One Ford plan, we have all those top-hats off the different core platforms and we now introduce those as they are needed and wanted around the world very quickly.
I think the data that we showed today about the new market segment introductions in China plus the refresh just is a terrific proof point about that. Because who would have ever thought we could be touching almost every market segment within a couple years? So I think absolutely the One Ford plan and the product plan is absolutely key to that.

    Good morning. Just had a quick question. If you look at the results from this quarter, obviously Europe it seems that things are at least becoming a little more certain and clear, obviously very profitable in APA. Do you get the feeling that at this point a couple years from now you could look back at about this time frame in 2013 and say that this is where all four major regions were locked and loaded and ready to go, and can kind of all coalesce and become profitable on a more even basis moving into the future?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bob Shanks,  Ford Motor Company - EVP, CFO    [103]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Karl, it's Bob. I think it's a very, very important point that you are raising. Obviously, our plan is for all parts of the Company to contribute appropriately to the bottom line. We are investing heavily in Asia Pacific and you are starting to see the green shoots come through there.
In the case of South America, we got them back into the black. They had been profitable for nine years in a row until the first quarter, so they are back in the black and continue to work hard to push them further into the black over time, particularly as we expand the product lineup down there with One Ford products.
And I think Europe is such an important story. It is a major restructuring. It is in an environment that is not a great environment. But we clearly are on a very good track to deliver the transformation plan that we laid out in October last year.
And it is not just for Western Europe, but we are growing in Eastern Europe. We have had a very robust activity in Russia with our partner Sollers there, so I think we feel very good about that.
The thing that is interesting about what happened in the quarter, which is so exciting for us, is that with the profitability that we saw in Asia Pacific which was quite meaningful, and return to profitability in South America, combined with the lower loss in Europe, we actually -- combined in those three regions effectively delivered about a breakeven. And I think in the first quarter that was a loss of over $600 million.
So it just demonstrates the power of what happens when we are able to get that part of the business contributing much more positively. Because with the strength of North America, the strong, solid profits from Ford Credit, and then to get that part of the business contributing, it is just going to be a dynamo. And very, very excited about what we saw in terms of progress there in this particular quarter.
