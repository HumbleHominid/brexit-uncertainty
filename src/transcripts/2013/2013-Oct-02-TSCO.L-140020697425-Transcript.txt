          Good morning, is my microphone working?  Good, well, good morning there's a lot to talk about this morning not least our European performance which we're going to cover in some detail in a short while.  But I'm going to start though with a summary of our work in the first half as we've continued on our journey to build a better Tesco.
Whilst we're trading the business in difficult conditions, my absolute priority is to position Tesco to win in the future.  It's through that lens, the one of sustainable multi-channel leadership that we look at everything we do these days.  And right across the business we've been working together towards our objective of being the leader in the new era of retailing.  This is true of the work being done every day by my half a million colleagues around the world as it is of the bigger strategic actions that we've taken.
And in the first half we've invested to strengthen our core customer offer in every one of our markets.  We've stopped opening as many new large stores.  We've switched more of our investment into digital growth and we've accelerated the transformation of our general merchandise business at home and in Europe.  So, we have made progress on our strategic priorities.  However, challenging conditions have held back that performance.
Here in the UK optimism is returning, it's fueled by better news about the wider economy.  Consumers are less worried about their jobs and the housing market is picking up.  But so long as wages continue to rise more slowly than the cost of living customers are still no better off.  And in the majority of our international markets economic conditions remain very difficult and in some such as Thailand, Ireland and Poland they've materially worsened for consumers.
I should say a word now about our competitors as well.  In tough economic conditions the competition is also improving its game.  Well, it's not my style to duck these issues.  We need to improve our game and that's precisely what we've been doing in the first half.
For us the impact of these conditions is compounded in our international markets by our bias towards large stores relative to some of our competitors.  In addition to the cyclical challenges that these stores are exposed to, we also face the increased threat of rapid online growth practically everywhere that we trade and a current surge in the growth of discount and proximity retailers.  As a result, the emerging improvements in the UK are being masked by the effects of these combined challenges.
I'm going to go into all of the strategic progress we've made in more detail shortly.  But in simple terms the UK business is getting stronger and we are starting to see this coming through in the numbers.  The fact it hasn't yet been translated into a stronger Group performance does not invalidate our strategy, our direction is right, our journey is underway and we know our momentum will quicken.
And that strategic progress that we're making for the Group is being guided by the approach to growth and returns we set out in April.  One very important example of this is the outcome of our strategic review in America which Laurie will take you through in more detail shortly.
Another clear example of our new approach to growth is the announcement today that we've agreed a joint venture with China Resource Enterprises, CRE, to create the leading multi-format retailer in China.  CRE want to work with Tesco because they recognize our world-class capabilities in online retailing, in systems, in global supply chain and our product expertise.
For Tesco it gives a 20% stake in a 3,000-store approaching-GBP10b-sales business and a much stronger route to one of the world's most exciting markets.  It will also move us much more quickly to profitability and does so without requiring significant amounts of new capital in the future.
This is a long journey, moving from the first curve from bricks and mortar retailing to the second, to multi-channel needs new skills, it needs new approaches and it needs a new culture.  In the near term we're not helped by economic or competitive headwinds in many places they remain strong.  But we're absolutely focused on building the most compelling offer for our customers in all of our markets and I am encouraged by the progress that we're making.
Now, you would be forgiven for pointing out that it's not immediately visible in the performance that Tesco reported today, but we're a very different business now to the one we were just three years ago.  A business which I believe has much stronger foundations for the future.  It's a bold, it's an imaginative and it's a decisive business.  I'll tell you more about how we're driving this change shortly, but first I'm going to hand over to Laurie, Laurie.

Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco Plc - CFO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you, Phil.  Good morning, everybody.  So we've -- as Phil mentioned, we faced a number of challenges in the half however there are a number of salient features that from my perspective demonstrate real progress.
Of course firstly, our biggest business, the UK, is growing its profits.  Secondly, despite the challenges to profit growth around the Group our cash flow's growing due to our more disciplined approach to investment, and thirdly, our exit from the USA frees us from the drag of losses, and our partnership in China repositions us for profitable growth.
So, now to the results, so the Group sales for our continuing operations for the half year were GBP35.6b, up 2% at actual rates and 0.5% at constant rates.  And Group trading profit was down 7.6% to GBP1.59b.  It's good progress in the UK being offset by the external challenges elsewhere and that's predominantly in Europe.  The underlying profit before tax declined by 7.4%.  Now we have shown the underlying profit excluding property profits in our press release this morning.  This is consistent with our comments in April and is a more accurate reflection really of the business that we run.  You can see here how the shape of underlying profit growth would otherwise be distorted by the scaling back of our sale and leaseback program.
Underlying net interest fell by 7.9% to GBP151m benefitting from our focus on average working capital and last year's number also carried an additional cost of the debt pre-financing that we did.
Tax has been charged at the effective rate of 18% and this reflects the helpful but obviously transitory impact of the lower UK corporation tax and the impact on our deferred liabilities.  Our underlying diluted earnings per share was 14.88p, a decline of 7.9%.  This is calculated at constant tax rates and therefore does not capture the benefit of the lower tax rate, but actually our actual taxes the decline would have been 6.9%.
Turning now to the segmental review, in the UK, our plans to build a better Tesco have continued at pace.  Our like-for-like sales performance improved from nearly down 1% in Q1 to flat in quarter two.  Clearly, we still have further to go, but this is a pleasing step forward particularly as it comes on top of the tougher comparatives such as the extended trading hours that we had through the Olympics.
Importantly, the major driver of the improvement in performance of our food business, sorry is our food business which delivered Q2 like-for-like growth of 1%.  Total like-for-like sales growth for the UK as a whole has been held back by our work to transform our general merchandise business.  We've continued to de-prioritize sales from those categories which have low catch gross margins such as consumer electronics, and instead we're focusing on more profitable categories that fit around the food first approach that we laid out in April such as toys, paper shop, home, cook and dine.
Of course, clothing is one of our best examples of a strong performing profitable non-food business for Tesco.  Now, in addition to a strong and improving sales growth through the half, the clothing margins also benefitted from a lower level of markdown and fewer promotions.  You can see it clearly on this slide from Kantar.  It shows how the proportion of full price clothing sales have growth very significantly.  This is due not just to stronger products but also better season management, in-store processes and much better stock management.
The points I've made about general merchandise are significant in understanding the profit journey for the UK.  For a number of years the food business has had to subsidize an underperforming non-food business.  The improvements are already made in clothing and starting to come through on GM and are key to funding the most compelling offer for customers while supporting the UK margin.
On Asia, before getting into the near-term impacts, it's worth remembering that our business remains robust and well positioned for growth.  They really do demonstrate what great businesses Tesco can build.  Over the last five years their sales have more than doubled and their profits have increased by nearly 120%.  You'll remember from my presentation in April that their returns are already mid teens.  With China now reported as a discontinued operation and its losses excluded, the strength of our Asian assets and their profits become even clearer.
As expected, the first-half results in Asia have continued to be impacted by the restricted opening hours in South Korea, our largest operation outside the UK.  We expect Korea to return to profit growth in the second part of the year.  However, the year-on-year sales will continue to be volatile in the coming months and this reflects the varying degrees to which the restrictions were applied in the second half of last year.
As you can see from this slide, Thailand has moved quickly into recession and this has been exacerbated in the retail sector by the government's efforts to drive domestic consumption with cheap financing of big ticket purchases.  The level of competitor openings has also increase.  So while we launched dotcom grocery in Bangkok and opened 131 express stores, others have accelerated their opening programs too particularly in the convenience sector.
These external factors have clearly had an impact on the sector as a whole and some elements of our own offer also contributed to disappointing like-for-like performance in Thailand.  This includes a number of unsuccessful changes to the merchandising of our important club pack range, which are bulk-buy products, a particularly important category for small traders who shop with us. We'll now take steps to address these and therefore expect some improvement in the second half.
It is worth noting that despite these changes Thailand had grown its sales on average by 15% per year over the last four years and it's more than doubled its profits over the same time.  Thailand's one of the strongest and highest returning businesses that we have.
In Europe, the macroeconomic pressures in our key markets are clear for everyone to see.  Most observers had assumed that Ireland, worst hit at the start of the financial crisis wouldn't see any further deterioration.  It, of course, has experienced its second recession in five years.
Poland's economy is still growing, but as you can see it has dramatically slowed.  More broadly consumer confidence remains subdued in all of the countries in which we operate.  Although these challenges affect everyone in the market for us they've been compounded by our bias towards large stores and by our exposure to discretionary categories.
Against this backdrop, like-for-like sales for Europe declined by 5% although we've seen a steady improvement in the performance through the period.  This like-for-like decline and our desire to maintain a compelling offer for customers has significantly impacted margins falling over 250 basis points to 1.2%.
Reflecting these trends and the negative sales gearing, Europe's trading profit was down by around 70%.  You can see from this chart that there were three main drivers; firstly, the impact of negative like-for-like, our investment in Poland, and the trading performance in Turkey.
Taking the impact of the sales decline first, Ireland is our largest market by sales in Europe and so the impact of its like-for-like decline was one of the larger impacts.  Trading conditions deteriorated across the half as Irish consumers faced another wave of austerity measures directly affecting disposable income.  We've therefore seen limited range discounters performing better than retailers who like us have a broader offer.
As you'll know, Poland is also a large market for us.  We described our plan to invest in the offer when we spoke to you back in June.  This investment operationally de-levers the Polish profits until the sales lift actually comes through.  The plan follows actually the same principles as the UK plan, such as investment in price, quality of fresh food and it's already showing encouraging signs as you can see from this chart.  Our smaller format stores exited the first half with positive like-for-like and I'm pleased that overall like-for-like for Poland has moved into positive territory in the first weeks of the second half.
Our Turkish performance contributed to more than a quarter of the year-on-year profit decline despite it only being 8% of the region's sales.  Effectively, our business in Turkey can be viewed as two parts.  The largest part in and around Izmir has much better economics than the business as a whole.  Our performance in this part of the business improved through the half.
The other part which includes some of our largest and most easterly stores in Turkey has far worse economics.  In fact, the sales densities of these stores are broadly half those of the stores in Izmir.  We closed eight stores in Turkey within the half, it's never an easy decision to do this but it's an important part of our work to refocus the business.
In addition, we've made three important changes to the business more widely.  First, we've significantly strengthened the trade plans with a particular focus on fresh food.  Second, we've accelerated our efficiency programs to address costs in our stores, supply chains and head office.  And third, we've made some important changes to strengthen the management team.  We have seen an improvement in trend of like-for-like sales for the country as a whole.  Nonetheless, in Turkey it's an issue for us and one which we are addressing.
As planned, we've opened around 200,000 square feet in Europe a 75% reduction in the amount of net new space compared to last year.  This reflects our more disciplined approach, we're investing capital at a level close to maintenance and focusing on high returning formats such as online and convenience.
Whilst the cyclical pressures persist, this disciplined approach has allowed us to manage free cash flow profile.  This chart shows the EBITDA less CapEx for Europe as a whole.  You can see that it remained strongly positive in the first half despite the challenges that I've laid out.
We're, of course, disappointed with our performance but it is important that we've remained cash flow positive.  We also expect a sequentially better level of profitability in Europe for the second half, helped by a number of factors.  First, in Ireland whilst trading is tough we have strong plans in place, the economy is fragile but it is starting to grow again.  Second, the benefits of our investment in Poland are already starting to come through.  And third, in Turkey, the trends have improved in addition to our increased management focus, I remind you that Turkey's profits suffered from a one-off of GBP20m in the second half last year.
Europe will be a challenging market for everyone for some time to come.  But in the second half of the year we start to annualize lower profits and easier comparatives, coupled with the change program, the specific initiatives in each market, we're confident that the second half will be much better than the first.
Trading profit for the Bank fell by 6.4% to GBP88m for the first half.  Excluding the GBP17m benefit from legacy insurance income last year and a smaller fair value provision release this year the trading profit actually increased by 21% in the first half.  It should also be noted that the first half includes a bad debt provision release of GBP10m.  This reflects better than anticipated cash recoveries; nevertheless, we do not expect to see the benefit reoccur.
Aside from this effect the Bank has seen strong growth in consumer lending, this partly reflects our use of the Bank of England's fund for lending scheme and our actions to pass the cheaper cost of funding onto our customers.
The insurance market though is a lot more challenged, with the average motor premiums across the market down by 15% on last year.  And our motor volumes reflect a very deliberate focus to offer the best prices to our loyal customers.  Over 90% of our new businesses in this area is drawn from Clubcard holders.  More generally we've also actively avoided no margin or low margin business derived from excessive discounting.
Looking forward, we expect the Bank to deliver a broadly similar level of profitability in the second half.
Since we met last April, my principal focus has been the two significant strategic moves in the USA and China.  First, last month we concluded the sale of Fresh & Easy to Yucaipa.  Once the sale is completed and the remaining stores have been disposed of, the total cash cost of exit will be no more than GBP150m but this does include a loan to Yucaipa of GBP80m which will be repaid in the future.
We could have chosen to conclude the review a little earlier, but I was determined not to enter into a deal which would result in liabilities coming back to haunt us in the following years.  I firmly believe that the outcome we have secured, which of course removes the drag of the US losses going forward, was worth waiting for.
The second strategic move relates to our announcement this morning, subject to the usual regulatory approvals, we're entering into a partnership with China Resource Enterprises.  Going forward, our share of the results from the partnership will be shown in the joint venture and associate line.  And as such for technical reasons our existing business is treated as discontinued within these half results.
Now in addition to the long-term strategic merits of the partnership that Phil's laid out there are also a number of immediate financial benefits.  First, we exchanged the full impact of our current losses in China for our share of the partnership's financial results.  Second, post integration the transaction will be accretive.  And third, the merged entity will be self-funding.  This means that we will remove the cash outflow relating to not only the trading losses but also the capital expenditure requirement for China in future years.
When we set out our approach to growth and returns in April, we shared this framework with you in order to clarify our commitment to shareholders for the years ahead.  Now, I'm going to finish my presentation this morning by giving you a summary of our progress under these guide rails.
Turning first to free cash flow generation, on a continuing basis whilst trading profits have declined this has been offset by strong and hard won working capital.  And that inflow is approaching about GBP300m for our continuing retail operations and we broke that out separately in the broker pack for you.  Underscoring this improvement, capital expenditure for the Group was GBP1.3b in the first half.  This is a reduction of over GBP200m compared to the same period last year and is driven largely by the reduction in Europe.
We're still expecting full-year CapEx of around GBP3.2b in line with guidance we gave you in April and as such it will take us to the next financial year before we move to the start of our targeted range.  And of course this is due really to the build-out of a number of large schemes still in our pipeline and we continue with the very important refresh program in the UK.
Net debt ended the first half at GBP7b, GBP200m lower than at the same point last year, helped by some of the factors I've just outlined.  This trajectory is in line with our plans to deleverage further and supportive of our objective to maintain the strong investment grade credit rating.  It's also despite significantly lower proceeds, in fact a reduction of GBP700m of proceeds in the first half.
Turning now to our medium-term guide rail of mid-single-digit trading profit growth; you may remember I described the role that each of the geographical reporting segments would play in the overall growth.  Starting with the UK, I described how low- to mid-single-digit top-line growth would translate into a similar level of bottom-line growth.  With our first half trading results of 1.5% we're making progress towards this guide rail.
With the significant growth opportunities in Korea, Malaysia and Thailand I described Asia's trading growth to be towards the top and higher end of the range, specifically excluding the impacts in Korea of restricted opening hours.  Now, if you add back the GBP40m impact, our adjusted growth rate in Asia is 4.4% showing again that we're making progress towards this midterm guide rail.
We said we expected Europe's profit growth to be at the lower end, recognizing the difficult economic conditions, our bias to larger formats and a much lower contribution from new space.  In the first half however, a lower than expected level of sales and a decision to invest in our offer has impacted our margins and as a result trading profit has declined leaving us short of this guide rail.
As usual we'll review our progress on ROCE at the full year.  Today, though I thought it worth reflecting on the positive affect of some of the strategic decisions over the last two years.  This chart uses last year's ROCE of 12.7% as a base.  The subsequent blocks then illustrate the benefit from our strategic decisions including the formation of our partnership with CRE.  And you can see that the total pro forma improvement of all these decisions is really quite meaningful.
Lastly, with respect to our guide rail, we know how important dividend is to our shareholders and we've maintained our interim dividend at 4.63p per share.
So, in conclusion while we've made good progress in the half we face persistently challenging conditions.  We expect a better headline performance in the second half helped by continued progress in the UK and improving trends overseas.  Whilst our overriding priority remains to deliver the most compelling offer for our customers across the Group, we remain committed to our medium-term guidance and the financial framework we laid out in April with a focus on disciplined capital allocation, free cash flow generation and driving returns.
Thank you, I'll now hand back to Phil.

Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks, Laurie, cheers.  So in April we outlined a strategy for the future shape of Tesco and we set out a clear framework for growth and returns in the future.  And we gave clarity to shareholders about how we'll deliver these.  And you'll remember our three priorities I hope; firstly, continuing to invest in a strong UK business; secondly, establishing multi-channel leadership in all of our markets; and thirdly, the pursuit of disciplined international growth.  And as I said in my introduction despite some very challenging conditions in some of the countries we operate in, the strategy is very much on track.  We've made progress against all three of these priorities and I want to take a few moments to update you on each.
Firstly, the UK, where customers are responding positively to our efforts to build a better Tesco.  We've continued to work to invest in all six elements of the plan that we set out 18 months ago.  Today I want to highlight some of the key areas that we've been particularly focused on.
Starting with food, it's at the absolute heart of our business and we've done a huge amount of work over the first half to ensure we've an industry leading supply chain which supports British farmers and enables customers to have confidence in how their products are made.  As an example, all of our fresh chicken that's sold in the UK now comes from the UK.  All of our beef, whether frozen, fresh or in our ready meals is either British or Irish.
We've strengthened our relationships with the farmers through the extension of our producer network to all dairy farmers.  And we've hired a new agricultural director from the National Farmers Union.  Our partnership with producers, which I first announced at the NFU conference earlier this year, is real and it is relevant.  It's the key to the transparency in our food supply chain.
It's also been important for us to do more to ensure customers are aware of and confident in the quality and the provenance of the food that we sell.  Food first is at the heart of our strategy and the start of our Love Every Mouthful campaign has played an important part in improving and reinforcing our food credentials.  Love every mouthful is not just a series of new adverts.  It's an enduring conversation we'll be having with our customers and with our colleagues and one which highlights the renewed passion for fresh foods.  The initial response has been everything that we hoped for and more.
We always expected that the first adverts would grab the attention of customers; it's come through strongly in our analysis.  And most pleasingly and as you'll see here the campaign has prompted nearly two-thirds of those who've seen it to think more positively about the Tesco brand.  And they've got in their minds there's a clear emphasis on quality.
We know we've got a lot to do with our brand and love every mouthful is only one part of that.  We were challenged of course by the changing attitudes to big business post 2008, being the biggest was no longer enough.  Increasingly, you're judged, and rightly I think, by what you contribute and not just measured by the money that you make.  So, we had to start 18 months ago with the basics, better perceptions of our core offer on price, on quality, on range and on service.
But it was also about having a much stronger relationship with our customers and with the communities that we serve.  It's started to gain traction now through our new approach to our role in society.  I think one of the clearest demonstrations of this different relationship that we're developing is the record level of engagement from both our colleagues and from communities around the country in initiatives such as our national food collection, which to date has provided 6m meals for families in need.
We've also raised more money in the first six months for our charity partner, Diabetes UK, than for any of our previous campaigns over the same period.  Our scale increasingly means we can and are making a difference for the good of society.
We shared this slide with you back in April it showed the significant step up in customer perceptions of service in our stores after the initial investment.  I'm very pleased that we've not only maintained but we've continued to improve on all of these metrics driven by our ongoing investment in colleague training and in the way we're helping our managers lead their teams in a new more collaborative way.
If I could just hold you on this slide though for a moment.  It was critical to get enough hours back on the shop floor last year before we could set other parts of our plan in motion.  And now for Chris and the team it's all about continuing this improvement week-by-week, month-by-month in order to give customers better service each and every time they shop with us.  It's one of the key measures that Chris looks at every week.  It's still moving in the right direction.  Our last period's performance is a record high for the UK, so well done to you and the team Chris.  And as you might know Chris visits a lot more stores these days than I do, so he's on it all the time.
Our work on range and quality has continued apace.  Having re-launched everyday value last year we've now completed most of our work on our core Tesco own brand.  With over 1,750 new and improved products launched in the first half, that's an extraordinary effort by John Scouler, who's here today, our Food Commercial Director and by his team.  The performance of this, the largest of our pillar brands has been a highlight of our progress so far in the UK this year.  It's delivered five consecutive quarters of strengthening like-for-like sales growth and it's performing significantly ahead of the business as a whole.  It's firm proof indeed that customers are liking the changes that we're making.
Well, John's now turned his attention to Finest, which is already one of the leading brands in the UK with sales of over GBP1.4b.  And here you can see some images of the new products.  The official re-launch takes place later this month.  It's already a GBP1.4b brand.  It's being supported by our first-ever TV sponsorship deal for Downton Abbey which we think is a natural fit with Finest.
John's aim with Finest is really quite simple; it's to be the best product in the market.  And over the last nine months he has reviewed the entire range to ensure that every product which bears the Finest brand is fit to do so.  And so he's in the process of launching over 400 new lines.  He's already removed 200 and he's re-specified the vast majority of the others.  Ahead of the launch, some of the first products are already in store and initial signs are very encouraging indeed.
Alongside this improvement in the perception of our products is the nationwide launch of price promise.  It's played a key role in reinforcing our price perception in giving customers the confidence that their shopping won't be cheaper elsewhere on branded products, on own-label products and on fresh foods.  And you can see a few of the results on this slide.  The improvements are continuing as more customers get to understand that price promise is here to stay.  We've already seen good results on price trust and on overall perception of price.
I think the most significant improvement to date though is the 34% increase in the proportion of customers who rate our ability to match or beat competitor prices as excellent or good.  And it's really important to customers in these difficult times.  I think when you look at the chart you can see the inflection point.  There is absolutely no doubt to us that this is a direct result of price promise.
Of course, we couldn't have launched price promise without addressing a number of issues that were getting in the way of clear price communication to our customers.  We've had a dedicated team working hard for more than 18 months to identify and more importantly to trace the root causes of these.  It resulted in the introduction of a much clearer internal price policy.  We're going even further to ensure our on-shelf pricing is logical and it's sensible.
We're introducing more automation to the links between different pack sizes so we can ensure customers see a bigger pack really is better value.  And we've started to roll out much clearer material in store, price promotion material to reinforce the changes that we make and to build the trust and the reliability of Tesco's pricing.
More and more customers now are starting to see a new face of Tesco as we've continued to refresh our UK store estate.  By the end of this year, we've refreshed -- will have refreshed just over a third of our space to some extent.  This refresh work can vary from changes to the look and feel of the store to a much more fundamental remodeling.
As such, the level of capital that's required and the associated improvement in trading performance can vary quite significantly.  And as my team will attest, the common theme for all of our refresh investment is that it will only be approved if it can achieve the high hurdle rates that we set, consistent with our approach to growth and returns across the Group.
I think and importantly as we make the physical changes to the stores we also change the culture of the store too.  We have more colleagues, they're better trained, they're more eager and they're more able to serve customers.  Chris attends the leadership training briefings for all of our leaders in Tesco these days.  They get to hear from him just how important this is to the Company and how we want them to make their contribution through leadership, helping our colleagues to serve better.
Just to give you a sense of the numbers involved.  You can see from this chart the amount of space we've refreshed since the launch of our UK plan 18 months ago and it's by format.  And the typical range of uplift that we've seen versus control groups of equivalent stores.  It's gathering momentum, it's evolving, it's incorporating learnings from each and every store we refresh.  As a result, the very latest refreshes are trending even more positively.
And a particular area of focus for the program this year is our superstore portfolio.  In total we've got more than 480 of these in the UK with more than 14m square feet of selling space.  And following the success of last year's pilot remodels in Bishop's Stortford, in Thetford and in Chester this year we're remodeling more than 60 following those principles.  They also include the latest generation pilots that build from Bishop Stortford, Thetford and Chester which are in Rochdale and Chelmsford.  You'll see there are significant changes in how the store is formatted with a much increased focus on food and the sales uplifts are compelling.
Of course, in addition to the uplifts that I've described, a key and a growing benefit of our refresh program is the potential to improve our gross margin mix of the stores, whether by tailoring the range to the local catchment or by deploying our latest thinking on space allocation.
Under Andrew Yaxley's leadership we've put particular focus on London; it's a unique market with unique submarkets in it.  We've got 445 stores trading within the M25 with a number of outstanding locations.  Andrew and his team have started to unlock a massive opportunity for us, creating offers tailored to specific shopping missions in each of the 445 locations.
He's already refurbished 80 stores this year and the results are very encouraging.  Sales [uplifts] in London so far are higher than our average with Metro a particular highlight at more than 8% and margins are materially up as well.  If you want a picture of how the momentum of growth will develop just take a look at London.
I know many of you joined us in Regent Street Metro last year and others have been pleased by some of the Express stores in St John's Wood and Marylebone High Street, they're fantastic stores.  They represent only one part of the work though that we're doing to tailor our stores to their local communities.
A much less well-known example but one I am particularly proud of is our Metro store in Upton Park.  This store first opened more than 50 years ago and three months ago its offer was very similar to any other Metro across the UK.  Today it is completely changed.  It reflects the needs of its very diverse catchment.  Andy's put in 75 new mods of food including a wide range of world food ranges and halal products.  Sales are up more than 10% since we made the changes, gross margin's improved.  We can see another 100 similar opportunities for this approach in London.
We've described before how the economics of the transformation in general merchandise will work.  Better, more sustainable margins, better cash profit.  Stronger sales densities, even stronger profit densities, albeit with a near-term drag on our overall like-for-like as we make the changes.
There's a far more fundamental and long-lasting benefit to the changes as well.  The new ranges we're bringing in and the own brand products we're developing are creating a business that's far more resistant to the present threat of online retailing.  They're also contributing to a much more compelling experience with products that inspire and delight customers.  The result will be strong, profitable growth.
You can see from these pictures some of what I mean.  It's much more about the new display equipment and the quality, the design, the choice, the value; it's a big step change.  Take the cushions, a different benchmark, greater value, much higher sales densities, better profit return.
Our F&F clothing brand has performed particularly well and we've refreshed 50 F&F departments in stores to our next-generation standard which you can see here on this slide.  Again, there's a real focus at F&F on how we merchandise the product, much more like you'd expect to see in a leading fashion retailer not in a supermarket.
I know customers love the new approach; I see it on their faces whenever I'm in one of these departments.  We see it in the strengthening sales.  The like-for-like sales uplift for the 50 stores to date is approaching 11%.  Chris is going to double the number of these stores in the second half of the year.
We talked in April about reducing our new space and the amount of net new space fell in the first half to only half a million square feet, much of it convenience.  As part of our review of the property pipeline, those large stores we did open were smaller than were originally planned, take Gateshead, take Sunderland, take West Brom.  They opened in the first half, all three in locations where we still knew there was demand for a Tesco store.  But by opening less space than originally we intended we've created future-proof schemes.  They're now offering outstanding retail destinations for our customers.
From this slide you can see Sunderland the original and the final plan.  We reduced the Tesco selling space by more than 30%.  I've been to the store; Chris has been to the store.  It's much tighter.  It's more productive.  Customers prefer it.  And we get rental income from the new tenant space.  And the presence of the tenants, uniquely in this case, a gymnasium has created a stronger destination for customers to visit.  The gym benefits from the footfall that comes from the trading.  Our coffee shop benefits from the customers going into the gym.
It's worth I think noting now that sales for the store are already ahead of our forecast for the larger store, for the 100,000-square-foot store.  Operating costs are lower for reasons you'll understand, so cash profit is better than it would have been.  That's even before you add the new income from the tenant.
This brings me on to the second element of our strategy to drive sustainable growth, multi-channel leadership.  To us it's about both the physical and the digital, about being the most accessible retailer across all channels for customers, in all of our territories.  I hope you've had the chance to see our extra remodels, in Watford, in Coventry or in Purley.  There are differences between all three.  They are tailored to their local market and to the size of the stores.  But similar concepts are at the heart of all three.  Food first, new GM, great clothing and the community space.
In Watford, you can see the fruits of our investment in the exciting brands, Giraffe, Harris & Hoole and Euphorium, all of which help create a truly compelling destination.  It's of course only an indication, but to give you a flavor that this makes, the average combined weekly sales of these three brands in Watford so far has been GBP80,000.  It's the third-highest turnover of Giraffe in their system.  It's the highest turnover for Harris & Hoole.  Euphorium has not seen experienced sales like it.  That GBP80,000 compares to our previous bakery and dining offer in Watford at GBP17,000.  I know some of you made a personal contribution to our takings since we launched in August, so thank you and please come again.
And in Coventry, a much different approach than Watford.  In some ways, it's the same.  It's new GM; it's smaller electrical.  I think it's the best F&F next generation we've done to date.  It's got a different bakery to Euphorium.  It's great value and it's got a Decks, our new casual dining format.  We love this store and how it's been transformed.
Convenience is a fast growing format and it's a key focus for us in most of our markets.  We're directing our store opening program towards it.  In the UK it was a third of new space opened in the first half.  Internationally if you exclude the three hypers we were committed to in Poland, smaller formats accounted for nearly half of our space. Perhaps even more significantly, since the start of the year, we've rearranged our existing portfolio of more than 1,600 Express stores in the UK.  It's part of the same program of work I mentioned earlier.  It's tailoring our offer in every store to the needs of local customers.  On average it's resulted in more than 800 product changes.  It's just one of the factors that's led to Express having the strongest improvement in like-for-like sales for any of our formats within the half and we only changed the range a few weeks ago.
Grocery online continues to get a lot of attention from Chris and the team.  In the UK, sales were up nearly 13% and we've got a share of around half the market.  And remember it's already a profitable business for us.  We're continuing to innovate with more ways for customers to shop conveniently with Tesco and have now rolled Click & Collect drive-through grocery to nearly 200 locations including to the first Express stores.  Following the successful opening of our fifth dotcom only store in Crawley this year, our sixth opens in Erith for London in a few weeks time.
Grocery home shopping now is not just a story for the UK.  It's now launched in nine of our international markets.  It's across more than 50 cities outside the UK and Ireland and it continues to grow strongly.
A culture of innovation now runs through the heart of Tesco and nowhere is this more true than in our digital entertainment businesses.  For us, digital entertainment is a way of not just generating incremental revenues but also developing closer relationships with our most loyal customers, using the power of Clubcard.
I'm proud to say we have assembled an outstanding team of leading experts and we've given Michael Comish, the co-founder of Blinkbox, responsibility for developing our offer across the whole Group in his new role of Group Digital Officer.
Alongside Blinkbox Movies, which has 10 times the number of new releases than comparable online retailers and Blinkbox Music, 10m tracks available for free on your smartphone, we're also going to launch Blinkbox Books following the acquisition we made last year of Mobcast.  That's going to offer 600,000 e-books to our customers.  Michael is also bringing together all of our digital expertise in a new app development center in Clerkenwell, which will build out the Tesco family of apps for the Tesco Group.
And then there's this.  You know it's the Hudl.  It's the tablet we launched just this week.  I'm enormously proud of this product.  It's a high specification piece of hardware and it runs Android on the platform.  It's at a price that makes tablet technology accessible to the majority of families in this country.
But it's more than just a really exciting product launch.  Hudl will be an important driver of loyalty too for most loyal Tesco Clubcard holders will benefit from an even better price through Clubcard Boost.  And the tablet is preloaded with Tesco apps, Grocery, Blinkbox and so on.  Here you can see the unique Tesco launcher accessible from the bottom left-hand corner of the tablet.
You may not realize this but three-quarters of families don't have a tablet computer in their homes yet.  And in the same way we introduced UK shoppers to all sorts of food they never thought they'd be able to access, we can do the same with technology.  Customers clearly think so too.  It landed in stores Monday and we've already shifted 35,000 units in two days.  A lot of them I have to say have been bought by our colleagues as they're keen to get their hands on one too.  But we plan for this to be the best selling tablet computer in Tesco this Christmas.
So to the third element of strategy.  You'll have seen from this slide at the prelims how important it is that I show it you again.  This focus on how we approach each group of markets is guiding everything we're doing outside the UK.  And we're not wasting time putting this strategy into place.
There could be no better illustration of this than our announcement this morning that we've agreed the terms of our partnership with China Resource Enterprises to create the leading multi-format retailer in China.  It's a move entirely consistent with our approach to these high growth markets where we're absolutely focused on capitalizing on the opportunities they present.  We want to refocus on a profitable, less capital-intensive approach to accessing it.
I think it's worth at this point reiterating that CRE has chosen Tesco to form this partnership.  They had the opportunity to choose from many.  CRE recognize our world-leading strengths in systems, in online, in loyalty and supply chain and product development.  That deal gives us a 20% stake in China's largest food retailer with 3,000 stores approaching GBP10b in sales working alongside an organization with unrivalled local expertise.
I was thinking how best to describe our partnership and I thought best to leave it to Chairman Long Chen.  This is the slide that he used to describe our partnership to his team.  I think it does the job perfectly well.  It shows how each of us bring complementary skills and benefits.  I've known some of the CRE team for many years and we've formed an even stronger relationship in the last two years that's led to this morning's announcement.
And let me be clear.  This is a step towards, not a step away from the huge opportunity that exists in China.  It is of course a new model for Tesco.  We do have a minority stake, but it is a true and an active partnership.  We'll have two seats on the Board -- that'll be Laurie and myself -- and we've clearly defined rights concerning funding, dividend payments and any potential future changes in the ownership structure.
In summary, the joint venture with CRE gives us a clear route to sustainable, profitable growth in the world's most populous market.  Importantly, it allows us to focus more of our resources on the three priorities of strength in the UK, of establishing multi-channel leadership and of disciplined international growth.
Earlier, Laurie gave you an update on our other businesses in Asia and talked about some of the specific issues in Europe.  He also described the early response to our initiatives in Poland and before I close I wanted to share some of the highlights of the Poland plan with you.
The team there have made a tremendous effort, one that's all the more impressive given the difficult trading conditions that they've faced and that consumers are engulfed in.  The first big initiative was the launch of our new price campaign, Ciach, in May which enabled us to significantly improve our price perception.  We've also significantly improved the presentation and the quality of our fresh food ranges, particularly in bakery and in produce and introduced many additional own-brand products across the shop.
One of the highlights which you can see here on the slide is the transformation of our in-store dining offer with the rollout of the bistro concept, hugely popular with customers, driving increased footfall, helping us to differentiate from our competition.  All of this work is hugely important; not least that it's moved our customer offer around significantly in our largest central European market.  IT also provides a blueprint for making further improvements in our offer across other European markets.
So, in summary, we continue to face difficult conditions in many of our markets and this has held back our financial performance despite some good progress in the UK.  I hope you can see from the actions we've taken that this team is absolutely focused on delivering the changes needed to create a retailer fit for the multi-channel world.
There will be bumps in the road.  We can't control the economic environment in the countries in which we operate.  But we're absolutely focused on what we can control.  And as you can see today, we've taken decisive action.  We've put the Group on a much stronger footing for the years to come.  Our strategy is on track.  You can see our new financial approach in action.
Our commitment is to create the most compelling offer wherever we operate.  By doing this, it won't just be customers who benefit, it'll be shareholders as well.  In this new age of retailing, we will regain our growth and our momentum.  Boldness, discipline and imagination, they are the foundations for growing our success.
Thank you and Laurie and I will be very pleased to take your questions.  Who wants to go first?  I'm going to start towards the back just over here, the guy with the glasses on his hand rest.  Thank you.  A microphone I think is in front of you.  If you'll let us know your name and who you work for, then fire away with the question please.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Al Johnston,  Citigroup - Analyst    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi, it's Al Johnston from Citigroup.  Actually just a few questions for Laurie on the China transaction.  First of all, could you specify how much CapEx has gone into China cumulatively up to this date?
Secondly, on the debt in JVs could you specify how much debt there was in the JVs which has gone now?
And thirdly, can you say how much the rental costs for the Group will be reduced by the China transaction and therefore rating relevant net debt.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco Plc - CFO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, on the net book value as opposed to what's the cumulative investment, the net book value of our business in China was about GBP1.6b.  I don't specifically know the debt that is associated with the joint ventures, but as you know it was third party debt.  And that debt actually will be maintained as these joint ventures eventually go into the joint venture that we've got with CRE.
So although the business is cash-free, debt-free, external debt that's associated with building up the Lifespace models will stay in place.  I'm afraid I don't know what the rental costs are that will come out.  So we'll have to come back to you on two of those questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you.  Another question over here on the left, John Kershaw I think.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Kershaw,  Exane - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, good morning guys, John Kershaw from Exane.  Two questions please.  First, on the UK clearly you are really quite bullish on progress, which is good and the stores look good, but the discounters are the sort of elephant in the room.  So perhaps expand on why you're comfortable that the margin can hold at 5.2% and why your own label architecture is relevant against that discount offer.
And then just on international I suppose the simple question is can we expect further disposals.  What is the strategic relevance for international when it doesn't move the Group needle sufficiently?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  Well, I'll let Laurie take the easy question first, the question of international, what's the point, it doesn't lift the dial and then I'll think about the discounters, this elephant in the room.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco Plc - CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, we're pleased with our Asia business division.  I think it does move the needle.  We've got a business in Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea, a GBP10b business.  In the first half it did GBP300m worth of profit.  That's in a half year, higher than some of the UK retailers that we compete against.  And those businesses now that you can see them that we've taken out the losses from China, the returns on those businesses are also excellent.  So I really couldn't take a question saying that they're not moving the needle.
Central Europe, it's a very fair question.  Of course, that region is extremely challenged by the macroeconomic environment.  I don't think any of us would have expected Ireland to go back into its second recession in five years and Poland's growth to drop from 5% to 1%.
Having said that the macros are tough, we've got leading positions in most of those markets with the exception of Turkey.  As a Group, with Ken's leadership, we've been very disciplined about the amount of capital that we've been putting in over the last two years, which is quite a change to the historical style.  So the cash flow is positive; it's not a drain on us.
We know that we've got these leading positions.  We're doing everything that we can to adapt our business which is really a large store format selling a big discretionary category -- I mean about 15% of our European sales are clothing and general merchandise -- to one that's more focused on the Internet and small convenience stores and a much stronger food business.
So we think we can work our way through the current macroeconomic environment.  It will take a while for that macro environment to correct itself, but we don't feel in any way the same as we felt about the US and Japan.
And a slight correction, we're not getting out of China.  We actually see this opportunity as a beautiful collaboration of two businesses coming together.  Imagine we've got 130 stores in China and we're going to have 20% of the biggest retailer in China which is going to be the biggest economy in the world by 2020.  It's not going to be a drain in terms of capital on us.  It's going to be profitable quicker than we could be on our own.
And we can bring what you'll see and have seen John in Thailand and Korea and Malaysia, fantastic IP, the intellectual property in our supply chain etc that will drive that business up in terms of returns and profitability.
So I've left out Turkey.  We don't intend to get out of Turkey either but we do have a business of two parts as I've described; one which is very profitable around the more affluent areas on the Mediterranean coastline.  Another business that's really out towards Ankara and Anatolia where actually the social demographic profile is very different, our stores are bigger and our sales densities are half.
So that is where Ken and [Jeff] and the broader Group team are doing most of their work to work out what's the best approach to what is amounting to about 30 stores of that total portfolio.
Long answer, sorry, but I thought it worth it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, I was able to write down lots about discounters so that was good.  Thank you.  I think that map on 25 sums it up though by the way, John, on Turkey.  You can see broadly speaking on that west coast, it's fine.  On the east -- when you move inland it's not and that's where we've got to make most of our efforts.
Laurie used a very important word there and that's collaboration.  When we were thinking about how the culture needed to change for this new era that we find ourselves in, this open era, we said there are five leadership skills that people in Tesco needed.  And we've always been known to be responsive.  When you knock us down, we get back up and keep on going.  You know we respond and we go.  We're very resilient.  So we didn't need to train people in those two, they've already got them.  It's sort of in our DNA.
But collaboration, empathy and innovation are three new skills we've been training in with our people, for almost a year.  I think what you heard then was that it was a new model for us in China and it is to collaborate.  It is to give them what we know and to help them to grow a business because we know a lot as many will be aware.  So I didn't want to leave it unsaid.  We've got to be more collaborative.  We are more innovative.  We've got to show more empathy.  It's difficult times for everybody, which is a neat segue into the whole issue of discounters.
They've done a very good job.  I think that's the first thing I have to say.  They've been very clever in finding the format and we, the leading supermarket retailers have largely left them to it.  And so you wake up and find they have 135 stores, Lidl in Ireland.  They've nearly got as many stores as Tesco now.  Our focus has been on these large edge-of-town, out-of-town stores.
The building blocks are really those John really hinted.  If you want to be a competitive force to them you have to be certain that your price is right.  And for Tesco that is from everyday value at the entry price points, which is benchmarked against those companies' brands, a strong Tesco own brand, the Finest.  Making sure that we reassure our customers about price through the price promise, ensuring a consistency of pricing.   What began to happen was somebody would move and we would move and then you'd get all this movement in price.  We've halved the amount of price movement in 18 months.  There's more for us to do.  It's a never-ending battle.
But just getting your prices down and getting your prices and shouting about your prices is not the answer either.  We have a leading competitor who loses more customers proportionately than we do to the discounters and they just keep on talking about price.  So it's in a more compelling, more differentiated offer and that's what we see.
And more proximity retailing is very important, so switching more of our space openings to local neighborhood markets.  For the first time in a long time, at the back of your pack, we've given you the stores we've opened in the first half in the UK and it's on page 11 of the appendix.  Just worth a little look.  Tesco is changing.  13 big stores opening, big store now bigger than 8,000 square feet.  Seven of those are the original hypermarkets or superstores and then lots of them are these 14,000 square foot in Gloucester, in Sheringham, in Faringdon, in Bermondsey, in Knightswood.  And then so much more is convenience.
So, no single, simple answer.  Differentiation, absolute focus on price, reassuring on price promise, price, quality, range and service.  It's never far away from Chris whenever I get to talk to him about making sure that's right for our customers.
Another question, please.  Let's go up here to the guy with the -- yes, thank you.  And then we'll come over here.  Thank you.  What's your name please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James Tracy,  Redburn Partners - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    James Tracy from Redburn Partners here.  Two questions from me.  One is on the improving trends that you showed in the UK.  Why do you think the improving trends are not showing in the market share data?  And are you confident that the market share data should improve in the second half?
And the second question is on the longer term margin objectives for Europe excluding Ireland.  If you assume that Ireland has a 5% margin then it implies that the rest of Europe is 0% margin.  So does that mean that -- is that true and can you see a path to better returns in Europe?  Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So again I'll give you the question on Europe and first half/second half, long term margin, what's the direction of travel.  And then I'll take the market share question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco Plc - CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We've never broken down the margins for Europe, so I don't intend to do it here.  Ireland is the stronger margin and stronger profit performer in the region.  We do see the second half improving for the whole of Europe.  And there are various reasons for that and I'll do my best to lay them out for you.
The investment that went into Poland in the first half of the year never gave the business enough time to get the benefit out of that investment.  And it was into price; it was into quality; it was into service.  So if you like, the investment went in but there wasn't enough time for the sales performance to come through.  So it operationally deleveraged Poland roughly GBP20m.
The one-time charges that we took in Turkey last year as I mentioned before were about GBP20m in the second half of last year.  We don't intend to repeat those and there's nothing that indicates that we will be repeating them from where we are today.
You'll know that the macro impacts started to really grip into our European business really in the fourth quarter and the back end of the third quarter of last years, so the comps that we've got are much more achievable.  You can see the trends specifically on what were the two biggest problem markets which was Poland and Turkey have already started to improve.  The like-for-likes are still negative in the quarters, but you can see there's a good improvement there.  And I did show you a chart on Poland where actually -- we're actually into the black now in terms of like-for-like growth for small format stores.  And actually for the first couple of weeks of the second half, it's looking much better.
There of course also is quite a big seasonal benefit that we get between the first half and the second half in Europe which helps margins.  So typically we do about 40% of our profits in the first half and 60% in the second.  So in addition to those one-times, a better investment plan that's going in, better comps, easier comps if you like for the second half and some seasonality, we're going to have a better second half in Europe than we did in the first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ken Towle is out here in the room.  We are disappointed with our first half.  Ken knows that.  His team didn't really see how tough it might be with this negative leverage when your sales gall that much.
So we've got a much stronger plan for the second half.  He's working tirelessly doing all the things that you might imagine and we expect that that business will improve its performance in half two.  If we'd have thought that it would have ended up where it had ended up when we were talking to you in Q1, we'd have told you.  We didn't think it was going to be as bad as it was.  So a lot to do, but a huge amount of work is being done.  And slowly but surely we're starting to see the benefits of it.
James, you asked a question about market share.  A lot of people want to measure us by our market share.  Now I think what we should measure ourselves by our, what are customers saying about our business; what's happening to our top line sales and our operating profits.  What's happening to our like-for-like and what's happening to the returns and are we positioning this business here in the UK to be the multi-channel leader for a new era of retail.  And everything we're doing is consistent with that.
I believe once we've achieved all of those objectives you will see our sales and profits improve and our returns improve and the market share will be what the market share will be.  What we want is strong sustainable business for the future.  That is where my focus is.  I don't take short-term opportunities at all now.  I just think for the long term because that's what people tell me I'm supposed to do and that's what I'm going to do.  And I think that's the right thing.
We don't make money out of launching the Hudl.  We will make money out of the Hudl, but in the short term we don't.  We're making big investments to improve our performance for the long term.
Thank you.  Another question, do you want to come here.  Thank you, sir.  You have to push a button.

Andrew Kasoulis,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, Andrew Kasoulis from Credit Suisse.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi Andrew.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Kasoulis,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi.  Two from me.  Can you tell us your like-for-like in consumer electronics in the UK please?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pence, very bad.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco Plc - CFO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, pence is very good, I'd say.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Kasoulis,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pence is the number.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco Plc - CFO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pence isn't (multiple speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Kasoulis,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And how long will it continue to be a drag?  It's been two quarters so far of I don't know minus 10 or something excluding the Hudl.  Do you expect it to be minus 10 or so for another two quarters?  And do you then expect it to go straight back to zero or will it be a drag for longer?  That's the first question.
And secondly, on Thailand you've given us some background on the pressure in the first half.  But it seems to have got worse in the second quarter on the first quarter, despite I think you told us last time around that a lot of the remedies can't be put in place in Q1 with the club packs, etc.  So what's got worse in Thailand please?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay.  Well, the like-for-like in consumer electronics is approaching double-digit negative like-for-like because we're backing out of so much.  If you go to any of the stores, you'll see whether it's a superstore, it's a convenience store or it's a hypermarket, the space is being reduced, the rent is being reduced.  Look at Watford and Coventry [signs].
It's going to continue like that for a while.  We're not planning that GM like-for-like is negative for the whole of 2014-15 financial year, but we are planning to change the GM range and space in every one of our large stores in the UK in 2014.  So we should be coming out of it strongly for the second half of next year.
What's really important though for us is that our profitability from general merchandise is improving.  We were in a situation two years ago where on around 15% of our sales in the UK, we didn't make any profit.  We've dramatically reduced the losses of our Tesco Direct business.  We've slowed down its growth.  We've refocused it.  And profit opportunities in general merchandise remain very significant.
Laurie, you showed that good chart which shows here's the opportunity for us.  As we improve our operating margins in GM, we'll be putting that into even more compelling offers for customers.  So that's my answer to you.  Thank you.
And on Thailand, the truth is we thought that we'd taken the corrective action in the first quarter.  And I was in Thailand about 2.5 months ago and it was clear to me that they had good plans, but they weren't biting hard enough.  So they've redoubled their efforts.
It really is around a combination of the economy getting just a bit difficult for consumers after the government stimulus of last year following the floods that you may recall and then our really losing our focus on an important part of our business which is the mom and pop club pack business.  Any of you who've been to our business in Thailand, you'll know how big a part of the business that is and that really lost its way.
So changes have been made and a huge amount of effort going on to improve it.  It was a little bit worse in the second quarter than we'd expected.
Another question.  Yes, thank you, just behind you.  And then we'll come over here.

Sreedhar Mahamkali,  Macquarie - Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Morning.  It's Sreedhar Mahamkali from Macquarie.  Two questions please.  Sorry to take you back to Europe.  Looking at full-year consensus, we've collectively been way off the mark clearly.  GBP327m I think is the consensus.  Help us here.  How should we be thinking about this year and should we be thinking '14/'15 will get you back into the low single-digit growth that you were expecting or is it that a bit too early in terms of evolution looking at '14 and '15.  That's the first question.
Secondly, on the UK I think on slide 60 you've given us quite a bit of detail in terms of the uplifts you're seeing in terms of sales and you also referred to gross margin uplifts.  Does that translate into trading profit or not?  Two questions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Well, I'll take the second and, Laurie, you can take the first.  It does translate itself into operating margin improvement, yes.  In the initial stages you make rather big investments and it goes into range and service.  You get slightly higher cost ratios; therefore, wastage is a bit higher.  And marketing costs are higher in the first eight weeks and then it starts to abate and then you see that falling through to the bottom line.  It doesn't happen in all stores because in some stores the changes that you make take it the other way.  But in general that's not the case.  Laurie.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco Plc - CFO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You want me to do --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I'll help with the --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco Plc - CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sreedhar wants me to do the consensus for Europe.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    GBP327m is the consensus, GBP55m in the first half.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco Plc - CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    First half of the year, GBP55m worth of profit, so to get to the consensus, it would be a significant step up which does look too much of a challenge.  So what I was trying to explain in the answer to the question previously was to give you some building blocks that helps you get back up to a number for Central, well, for Europe for the second half.  And we do think that that the second half will be significantly better from a profit perspective than the first half.
But to just go through those again, a GBP20m investment in Poland in the first half.  We'll get operational leverage from that investment in the second half.  We took some one-time charges in Central Europe last year specifically Turkey roughly of about GBP20m, so that shouldn't happen again.  There is seasonality.  So we should get an improvement from the first half to the second half just because a lot of the big seasonal events happen in the second half of the year.
And then the really difficult question is in a challenged environment for consumers and specifically challenged around real wage growth we can see improving trends in our performance, but how much of that is actually going to come through.  And that really is the question.  We're anticipating good profit growth in the second half, but I also can't exactly put a number on it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks, Laurie.  We'll take a question here and then I must come to this side of the room because I'm ignoring this side.  So yes, at the back.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Gadsby,  Societe Generale - Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi, Tom Gadsby from Soc Gen.  Just on the refreshed stores, you say 3% to 5% uplift.  Can you split that out please between basket size and footfall and what sort of returns you're seeing on that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I've given more information about that than I've ever given before.  It is both.  We get an uplift in basket size in the early stages.  We get an uplift in footfall in the later stages as people get used to it, get to hear about it, come and see it, word of mouth spreads about it.
Thank you.  So I'll come over here and I will take one in the front and then one right at the very back.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clive Black,  Shore Capital - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Clive Black from Shore Capital.  A couple of questions.    In terms of the UK, a lot of chatter in recent weeks about the robustness of your UK margin.  In the past you've talked about an expectation that the UK margin would remain for the foreseeable future at the level you'd based in April 2012.  Could you give us some color on the dynamics as to why that should be the case, maybe gross margins and productivity programs?
And then not such a polite question really on Central Europe.  You've talked about improving trends in the second quarter for you.  If that's the case, why didn't you guide the market down materially at the end of Q1 as to the magnitude of the miss that was going to take place this year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you.  Well, had we known in Q1 that the magnitude of the miss was going to be as great we would have, but we didn't.  The actions that we took in the first quarter didn't give the result that we'd expected in the second quarter.  And there's your answer.
We could see it coming, but we didn't see it to the degree and extent that we are.  And you're sat right behind the guy who has to come and tell us the number and we were talking in the last month about the scale of it and what that would mean.  So that's why we're being a little bit more open about what really did happen, Clive, and what we think can be better about it in the second half of the year.  Ken at that moment shifted uncomfortably in his seat.  Sorry, Ken.
On the UK margin, I think we have shown slides before about the great opportunity that we have in the UK and I've already alluded to some of those.  First of all, I have to say our productivity programs continue the work that Chris and his team have been doing -- actually that Larry began with our supply chain strategy.  We've opened two new mega DCs and we've closed the number.  Reading's come on stream.  It's the biggest DC we've got outside of one actually, Magor.  It's the most productive.  It serves into the west of London.  It's built on very old, built in the 1980s distribution centers.  That's giving us a big spurt in distribution productivity.
And then we have a great opportunity because Dagenham has come on stream which is our new chilled distribution center.  It's replaced another DC that was actually opened in 1984, which was so cramped and so crowded.  We were servicing a lot of convenience Express stores with a DC that was actually designed for big out-of-town superstores.  So that's been a very big and a very important change.
Chris is continuing to drive productivity through the application of in-store technology.  Mike McNamara is here who spends a lot of time trying to find new ways of automating processes.  The self-service checkout program has doubled in 2014.  It's really loved by customers but it drives up our productivity significantly.
And then I mentioned how GM was not making any return for us two years ago.  We know that -- you know, I think, that our online GM business wasn't profitable.  We've started to correct those.  So we see food no longer having to subsidize GM and clothing.  Clothing has gone nicely into profit and is giving good sales growth.  That's why we're giving it more space.
And then there's the work that Chris and John have been doing around other ranges of the stores.  It gives you a sales lift, but it gives you a margin improvement.  I was in the store on Saturday morning and I said to them, to the store manager, what's it been like now you've got this range?  She said, well, customers are coming in and thanking me.  There were things that they wanted to buy that they couldn't.  Scratch cooking, it's just becoming more normal that people want to scratch cook so they want cooking ingredients.  Just putting in half a mod of cooking ingredients in an Express convenience store, surprise, surprise, people buy it and they don't have to go somewhere else to get it.
So it's the fusion of our Clubcard data with our knowledge of space planning.  And Chris spends more time in the merchandising center than I think he does in his office.  And John spends more time than Chris in it.
So that's really a long-term -- near-term guidance.  We thought it was important that we said there's a floor here and it's 5.2% for a while because you could have just seen everyone thinking that margin's going to drop.  It doesn't have to be 5.2% forever.  It doesn't have to be 5.5%.  It might be 4.8%; it might be 5.5%.  What we're going to do is we're going to make sure we've got the most compelling offer and we expect to see our like-for-like sales improve over the mid-term.  That's what we're about now.  Sustainable improvements in the business shaped for a new era which is the multi-channel era.  Sorry for the long answer, but that's what I keep on telling my people, and hope that they'll believe me anyway.
Right at the very back please, thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James Grzinic,  Jefferies - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, hi.  It's James Grzinic from Jeffries.  I had two but I don't have the one, just as a follow on of what you just said.  So is the 5.2% a floor or isn't?  That is the first one.
And the second was what are you observing in terms of promotional activity in the UK?  And what you were telling us in terms of couponing activity back in January from your own plans is that still valid now?  Are you going to start winding that down?
And thirdly, if I were to look at your cash flow with China still fully consolidated next year, what does the deconsolidation do in terms of cash flow profile and when do you think you'll start getting a dividend out of that equity investment?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you.  Well, on the first question, which was is 5.2% a floor or not, we don't see any need to move from 5.2% at the moment.  We see plenty of opportunities to improve it.  But what we'll do with the improvement is we'll put it back into a more compelling offer for customers.  We want that 15% of our business that wasn't returning to begin to return and then we know what we want to do with it.  We want to make our offer more compelling.
And when I said it could be 4.8%, it could be 5.6%, in the long run, it could be.  But right now we plan to do is continue to improve our offer for customers and I've shown you through productivity initiatives and through more compelling offers and through an improvement in general merchandise post the transformation, this time next year we would anticipate to be able to deliver more for customers.
Cash flow next year was the question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco Plc - CFO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.  The joint venture initiative it is good that you picked up on it, James.  It's a significant boost to cash flow for the Group going forward.  So China itself in terms of operating losses and we'll use that as a proxy for EBITDA was roughly about GBP100m when you took the trading losses of GBP70m.  The joint ventures were losing about GBP20m and the interest costs of the debt that we had in the joint venture was about GBP10m.  So it's been about GBP100m per year for the last two years at least.
And then we've been putting in, in the region of GBP300m to GBP400m of CapEx every single year into China as we build out the Lifespace models as well as fit out the leased stores that we've got predominantly around the rest of the country.  So because the joint venture is self-financing, that cash flow doesn't get drawn out of the Group.  As soon as we complete and get regulatory approval from Mofcom which should be about mid-year, mid calendar year next year.
With regard to dividends, we've agreed up front not to take a dividend out of the business for at least three years.  And then post that to take our share of the dividends if we so decide to do so.  But we might decide, look the growth is so good, let's just invest everything back again.  But we can take our dividend out after three years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you.  Our promotion activity broadly is like for like now.  We don't do much more, we don't do much less.  It's much more targeted, but we're still using the above the line fuel promotions.  They're very popular with customers.  And we're still using five off forties as and when we feel it works for us.  But much targeted now than ever before in our mix.
Thank you.  Another question, thank you.  Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jaime Vazquez,  JP Morgan - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hi, it's Jaime Vazquez from JP Morgan.  A couple of questions.  One on the dividend, can you remind us of the policy?  Is to grow in line with earnings but only when earnings grow?  Should we expect a flat dividend for the full year?
And the second one is coming back to the discounters, I mean it's clear that you have to fight against them with many things other than just price and I agree on the differentiation.  But if we focus on the price element do you think that matching with everyday value is enough or do you think that your core only will needs to be re-priced?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you.  Well, on page seven and littered through the slides, our dividend plan is, our guiderail is in line with underlining earnings per share and a cover of more than 2 times.  Our earnings per share fell underlying in the first half and we chose to hold the dividend.  We did that last year.  We held the dividend.  The decision is the decision of the Board in the second half of the year and it will be announced then.  We know how important the dividend is to our shareholders and so we're always very careful and so far we've held it in times when the business has been readjusting.
On the discounters, our standard Tesco brand has been, is being and will continue to be improved.  I referred to it in my opening remarks.  And that will continue.  And the work on everyday value that we did last year that significantly improved its quality and therefore its value.  It did start to push up to some of our Tesco brands and some people have written about the fact that some of the products are very similar.  We've been able to find a few.
John was able to explain to me what he's doing about that and I'm pleased to say it's in his plans to make sure there is a perceptible difference where it's possible.  And that's what you'll see Tesco doing constantly refreshing the products that we sell.
Another question please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edouard Aubin,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, sorry.  Edouard Aubin from Morgan Stanley.  Just to follow up on pricing, sorry for this.  You just talked about private label, but if you can come back on national brands.  Some third party surveys including our own have shown that your pricing on national brands might have deteriorated in recent months.  Do you think on national brands in the UK you have a relative price positioning issue you would want to correct?  Or you're fine with your relative price positioning in the UK?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco Plc - Group CEO    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    By and large, we're very pleased with our price policy and our price position.  We look at it on a very wide range of prices because we're able to.  We don't see any of this deterioration.  We're very confident and very pleased, thank you.
Another question please.  Oh, I've exhausted you, excellent.  Well, thank you very much for your time.  Have a good second half of the year.  We're planning to do so too.  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco Plc - CFO    [41]

    Thank you.
