Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Deutsche Post DHL conference call regarding DP DHL full-year results 2012. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. The floor will be open for questions following the presentation.
Let me now turn the floor over to your host Mr. Martin Ziegenbalg.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head, IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. And good morning and hello to everyone out there to our full year '12 conference call. I take it that you have all the material that we sent out this morning in front of you or accessed it via the web. You are aware that the annual report including the notes will, as we said, be published next week March 12.
And with that, I would say let's turn to the presentation by Frank Appel our CEO and Larry Rosen our CFO right away before we go into Q&A, so Frank please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, thank you, Martin. Welcome, good morning, good afternoon wherever you are. So I am happy to present you now the overview about what the effect of our strategy has been and how the structural trends will sustain our growth into the future.
If I go to page three you can see the summary of the year-end. We are very happy that we have seen a very strong performance in Q4; that we have met all of our targets we have laid out earlier. The business is supported by the fundamental trends we have shared with you before, the very strong Parcel growth as much as our strength in the developing countries, and our focus on simplifying the customer experience and to optimize our processes.
And that is the basis for the EBIT guidance for this year which will Larry explain later on in detail, where we are looking for a EUR2.7b to EUR2.95b EBIT target.
On page four you see the comparison of our guidance with our actuals. We are very happy that we met all these figures at the Group level with EUR2.67b, on the Mail just in the middle of range, the DHL division slightly above and the Corporate Center/Other as well around the EUR400m.
On page five you see that this has been supported by all divisions. And we are very pleased that Mail is now flat on the top line. You see here a minus 5% development, but please don't forget that we had earlier last year the settlement of a 12-year VAT dispute with the government which had impact in the Mail division of EUR150m. So if you exclude that we have even seen an improvement year over year.
Express, very nice top line growth, bottom line is up as well. We should keep in mind that EUR100m of that came from releases due to not needed provisions for the restructuring in the US. But even if you exclude that we are now at above EUR1b, slightly above EUR1b and have a nice year-over-year growth.
Forwarding relatively flat on the top line, you will see that later on as well. Volumes are not particularly strong but the bottom line has improved against the industry trends.
Supply Chain a good growth and very nice development on the EBIT level as well. And overall we have seen 5% growth and 10% EBIT development. So we think that's a pretty good set of numbers.
Next page, we will continue to let our shareholders participate on our success even if we keep the dividend flat. We are now going to a more normal level of 53% dividend of our underlying profit. It is still a very attractive yield for the shareholders, and it's as I said in the midpoint or close to the midpoint of our range we have given you a couple of years ago already.
On page seven, the development of the Mail volumes, unfortunately the trend of declining volumes in the core Mail Communication business has not changed. Further decline we observed last year. But fortunately it was compensated by some very strong growth through the whole year on the Parcel front.
Maybe two things to remember we are probably less impacted by the decline than many other postal operators, because we had always significantly less volumes per capita than our competitors. And you see that here on that page the comparison, but the decline has been much smaller as well. We always said that in several conference calls we can't lose the same volume twice. And the Financial Institutions business, which is still very strong in some markets, was already gone a while ago and we can't lose that again.
The upside potential is shown on the bottom, we are now more or less breakeven with the revenue increase in Parcel in comparison to the decline in Mail. The good thing about that is what we have mentioned several times different from some other postal operators we have for most part of Germany an integrated delivery. So if we replace revenue which we lose on the Mail side, by revenue which comes from Parcel it is helping us to share the costs we have for an integrated network. And of course we will continue to optimize the cost, and we have also these price increases effective January 1 for 2012 (sic -- see slide 7, "Jan 1,2013") which makes us confident to make the guidance for this year again.
Express on page eight, a continuation of the nice volume development and the revenue development we have seen throughout the year. We are confident and convinced that we have gained market share again. It comes -- this is a result of our clear focus on TDI and our very strong market position in especially Asia. We are perceived in many services we did as the best provider with regard to satisfaction and loyalty. And we have continued to invest systematically in our network as you might remember from our opening of the North Asia hub.
On page nine Forwarding, Freight, the numbers are not as nice as that of Mail and Express. We see a decline in Air Freight even if it slowed down in the fourth quarter. It's a consequence of down-trading from Air Freight to Sea Freight. It's also a result of the relatively weak overall growth we have seen around the world. And finally it's also impacted by our strong footprint in the high-tech industries, or the high-tech industry which has down-traded probably more than some other industries. On the other side on Ocean Freight, we have seen as the market growth, and we probably have grown through the year similar to the market.
The good news is different from the trend in the industry we have improved our gross profitability in a good way and that has led definitely to an EBIT improvement too. And in addition we had significant costs already in 2012 for NFE, the new forwarding environment, and we will continue to do so in 2013. But the good news is it's well on track and we are very happy with the progress we have seen so far.
Final division, Supply Chain, another year of good new signings. The good news is the signings have higher margins than the wins in 2011 and 2010. We see that as a sign that we are now better paid for the high quality we provide and that's very encouraging because that should mid-term lead, or even short-term, mid-term lead to better margins in that business as well.
So this is the status quo with regard to how much we have delivered in 2012. Now let's look into the future and let me talk about the structural trends. On page 12 you see what has happened in the recent years with regard to the revenue share of the emerging markets Asia Pacific, LATAM and Middle East Africa.
You see here a very healthy trend, the share of revenue which comes from those regions has increased in all divisions. It's a reflection of our very strong market position being number one in Express, being number one in Air Freight and number two in Ocean Freight and also being the market leader for contract logistics in many of these major markets. So we have no doubt that this will continue, and we will see further growth in these parts of the world. And as you might remember we have a goal to generate 30% of our revenue for the Group out of Asia.
Then on page 13, another trend which is sustainable and we expect to continue for the next years is the e-commerce trend. We had in December an all-time parcel volume record which set more than 7m per day.
We continued to invest in that infrastructure as already communicated earlier. We are providing new services being the Easy Return in the Mail division, or the premium product we offer for time critical B2C shipments which is growing as well in the Express division. And also the end-to-end service for Webshops, we have expanded and we have some very nice wins as well in that arena for Fulfillment.
Page 14 that's only a reminder for all of you. You probably have seen that several times for different sectors. We are very proud of our capabilities, our scale of our sector teams like in this case 4,000 experts. We have very industry-specific products which are growing nicely, and we continue to invest in our infrastructure and that makes us confident that we can continue to gain share and grow profitable.
So on page 15 is a summary, since the fundamental trends are intact and we had a very good year where we met all the expectations in 2012, we are confident that we are on the right track to deliver our mid-term target we gave you at the last Capital Market Day with our EUR3.35b to EUR3.55b for the Group.
We think we can continue to stabilize the EBIT of Mail at above the EUR1b, as we have done already in the last three years. And we will continue to grow our EBIT base on 2010 in total by -- to 13% and 15%.
So far 2010 to '12 it's 15.3% EBIT development. And you see on the bottom that is the result of the significant margin improvements we have experienced in all the three divisions. And of course that will be the focus going forward in addition to the growth that we improve our margins as explained at the last Capital Market Day in detail going forward.
So that's what I wanted to share. So we are happy with the progress we have seen in 2012. We think the structural trends are intact and that should position us well for further growth and keeps us on the track to deliver our 2015 targets.
And with that, I would like to hand over to Larry for more detail on our financials.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks. Good afternoon to everybody. Good morning to those joining from the States. I am very pleased to continue with our report on Q4 and the full year, and would like to focus now on financial performance for the year and then finish up with a review of our guidance for 2013.
So over to page 17, here is our profit and loss statement for the full year 2012; we'll look at Q4 on the next slide. Revenue increased by over 5% helped by positive currency effects and a flat organic revenue performance in Mail and Global Freight and Forwarding was complemented by good revenue growth in Express and in Supply Chain.
EBIT was up 9.4% with a small decline in Mail and pretty good double-digit growth in all three DHL divisions. We had some one-off effects as most of you know during the year, but they ended up mostly offsetting each other. And if we use the word underlying it would have been just slightly higher than what our reported EBIT ended up being at EUR2.66m.
The financial result was impacted both in 2011 and 2012 at the beginning of the year by the final adjustments related to the Postbank sale and by the 2012 VAT settlement from summer of last year.
We were very pleased with the tax rate development during the year, as our improved performance allowed us to activate more tax loss carry-forwards, especially in the US. That allowed the tax rate to come down to 20.5% compared to our original forecast of 27%.
Net income was up around 43% for the year, though it was also impacted by those final Postbank adjustments. Adjusting for all one-off effects, net income was up by a little over 10% very much in line with the growth in our operating income.
Now over to page 18, and the fourth quarter P&L finished the year on a very positive note with EUR827m of EBIT, an increase of 38% versus last year. It was our highest quarterly performance since Q4 of 2006.
The strong year-over-year increase was somewhat influenced by charges of around EUR100m, which we had in Q4 of 2011 but was nevertheless a very solid performance influenced by seasonal factors and very good cost and efficiency management. Net profit almost tripled and was up 47% on a clean basis over Q4 excluding the Postbank transaction adjustments.
On page 19, I want to spend some time on two subjects that are very much in focus for us, the first being cash flow performance and the second being pension. And let's start on this page with cash flow performance, and you see here the evolution of our debt during 2012. Excluding one-off or special effects our net liquidity would have remained about constant for the year at around EUR900m. So you see towards the right side of the slide the EUR880m, it would have been down just slightly from the EUR938m where we started the year.
However, a number of items contributed to a debt figure of just under EUR2b at the end of the year. First, pension funding increases net debt but is really from an economic point of view the exchange of one kind of long-term liability for another. In fact, we believe this transaction is credit rating neutral and will also be earnings and cash flow accretive.
Then we had the two non-recurring events, the historical VAT settlement and also the state aid payment totaling together close to EUR800m. Finally, we had some leftover payments of EUR140m from our US restructuring that we charged to the P&L in 2008 and 2009. As a reminder last year it was just over EUR200m so it's coming down quickly, EUR140m in 2012 and we expect it to come down further.
So that's the balance sheet perspective on cash flow and liquidity, let's have a look now on the cash flow statement perspective actually on the next two slides.
So on page 20 we've taken out all the special effects which you see in the bubbles to show our ongoing cash flow performance. And starting with our EBITDA of around EUR4b we have the usual changes in provisions cash-out primarily for pensions and other employee-related matters that we had booked through the P&L in prior years, in some cases, i.e., pensions very many years ago.
Our working capital performance was, frankly, a bit disappointing in 2012 and was influenced by both the discontinuation of a factoring program and by a pretty big swing from the end of 2011 to the beginning of 2012 especially on payable levels.
After reducing CapEx and interest payments or after excluding CapEx and interest payments we were left with the EUR723m of free cash flow, around EUR100m less than needed to cover our dividend payment for the year. And that's something that we want to change beginning this year. And you will see in a few minutes that we are now making it a formal part of our guidance starting in 2013.
So over to page 21, here you see the add-back of those special and non-recurring items leading to the recorded free cash flow of around EUR1.9b at the end of the year. But again the pension funding is more accounting than really negative cash flow. Again, one has to differentiate between accounting convention and real economic and credit quality effects. Our pension funding simply exchanges one kind of long-term liability for another and should not be seen an as an overall increase in debt. That's our view, but importantly also that of the rating agencies.
So on to page 22, what's in store for the future in terms of cash flow development? We believe that Deutsche Post DHL is set for a significant improvement in cash flow performance in the next years.
Consistent with our 2015 EBIT guidance, our operating income will increase by EUR700m to EUR900m per year compared to 2012. Pension payments will tend to decline slowly and cash-out for restructuring where we had EUR140m this year will decline somewhat faster. Working capital and taxes will require a bit more cash as we continue growing the business over the next years. And investments should decline from the 2011 to 2013 peak of EUR1.7b to EUR1.8b per year. After 2013 it should begin to reduce a bit. And all those factors should contribute to a sharply increasing cash flow generation over the next years. That's our plan and our expectation.
So on to page 23, let's take a look at the second subject that I mentioned, pensions. There are a number of effects here that happened at the end, mostly at the end of 2012, and then some more which will happen in 2013 and which I'll review on the next slide.
First, we had a good year investing the plan assets with returns of over EUR400m. Second, the decreasing interest rate environment led to a calculated increase in our defined benefit obligation, our DBO, and in the unrecognized gains and losses. Finally, the EUR2b funding we did in December reduced the unfunded liability by the same amount, and increased our overall funding ratio to 66%. That compares to 56% at the end of 2011.
Now on to the next page. In 2013 the introduction of the new accounting standard IAS 19R means that we will no longer be able to use the so-called corridor method to amortize unrecognized gains and losses. Instead the EUR3.1b of unrecognized losses that we had at the end of 2012 will be added to the pension provision through countercharge to equity. This means that the level of the provision and equity will be highly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels in the future.
For the P&L we expect the accounting change will be about neutral for EBIT but positive for financial expense. And of course this accounting standard change has no impact on our cash flow performance.
So on to page 25 and a closer look at the Q4 performance by division starting with the Mail division. So revenues were almost exactly the same as prior year which was also almost exactly true for the entire year 2012 compared to 2011. This reflects the effect of Parcel growth offsetting the decline in Letter Mail.
EBIT performance was very good as the usual seasonal impact was felt, cost management continued to be very effective. And for comparison in 2011 we had non-recurring effects related to the then new labor agreement. Cash flow was heavily impacted by the pension funding but was reasonably strong on an underlying basis. And CapEx was dominated by spending on our comprehensive upgrade of the Parcel network.
On to the next page and the Express division, revenues and EBIT continued to reflect the trends from prior quarters where we continued to grow faster than market, and EBIT margins stayed relatively constant. The margin development reflects the benefits of volume growth or operating leverage offset by higher costs we are absorbing from investments in the business. These investments include expanding our air fleet and hub network, upgraded customer service and quality measures and increased employee training. Accordingly, CapEx remained at a relatively high level in Q4 and the entire year 2012.
Now on to page 27 and Global Forwarding and Freight division, continued to perform very well despite negative growth in Air Freight and only slow growth in Ocean Freight. Gross profit margins continued on a favorable level as the carrier/supply demand relationship remained overall favorable.
In addition, intensive cost management, especially overheads, more than offset the additional expenses we had for the implementation of our transformational new forwarding environment or NFE project which some of you may remember.
And on to page 28, last but not least, our Supply Chain division had a very strong close to the year with EBIT margins increasing to over 3% in Q4. This reflects the continuously increasing benefits from optimization of the contract portfolio.
This is in turn made possible by very disciplined contract acquisition and renewal and the ability to win attractive new business based on our sector and solution capabilities. Cash flow was very strong in Q4 reflecting a very good trend in both EBIT and also working capital levels.
Now let me turn to our guidance for the full year 2013 on page 30. For Mail we expect EUR1.1b to EUR1.2b of EBIT. This is on par or slightly less than 2012 on a clean basis, i.e., without the EUR150m VAT charge. Here we see continuing Parcel growth, and the price increase that we had starting January 1, being offset by further moderate declines in the Letter Mail volumes and moderate factor cost increases. Of note is that we remain clearly above our mid-term target of at least EUR1b EBIT per year.
DHL EBIT is expected in the range of EUR2b to EUR2.15b. In thinking about the year-over-year trends from 2012 to 2013 it is important to remember that we benefited in 2012 from the release of a restructuring provision if you remember in the middle of the year around EUR100m, and that 2013 will include incrementally higher spending for NFE in the high double-digit million range. With Corporate Center remaining around EUR400m, total EBIT should therefore be in the range of EUR2.7b to EUR2.95b.
To emphasize the cash generation improvement we see and it's important to us -- its importance to us we introduce cash flow guidance for the first time, and expect to generate at a very minimum sufficient free cash flow to fund the dividend which we pay out this year.
And now to sum up on the next page, in 2012 we had successful delivery on all of our targets in what was a volatile and in some ways difficult year. We continued our strong focus on further optimization of our businesses in line with our strategy.
And for this year we expect to have an EBIT increase which will in turn drive a stronger free cash flow performance. And despite the still lower than trend level macro environment, we are committed to deliver on our 2013 and on our longer term targets.
So, thanks for listening, and we'd be happy now to hear your questions.

Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions). The first question comes from Stephen Furlong from Davy Research. Please go ahead with your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen Furlong,  Davy Research - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi. I just want to ask actually about forwarding. Maybe if you just talk about where is the NFE project in terms of the IT rollout, how much management time does it take?
And then maybe just in general on Forwarding, maybe if you could just talk about whether you see maybe air freight volumes making a comeback this year or do you think it's just structurally moved from air freight to sea freight. Do you have any view where you see maybe pricing going in air and sea freight as well that would be great, thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me start with answering the question with regard to management attention, of course such a change program always takes significant time because we are going through a transformation of the business model. But that was already the case in the last 18 months, so -- and therefore I am quite confident that we will see good progress in 2013 again because the organization has already digested that for 18 months.
The organization is an organization which has adjusted two major integrations with Exel or with AEI. So we think there is of course attention to that point, but it has not taken us away from growing the business profitable, so I think this --.
The other two elements how strong the markets will really develop is very much linked to the overall market development. And the next six months will remain challenging and there might be a chance for an upswing in the second half or latest in 2014.
And there is definitely as long as the markets are weak there is a trend from -- away from air freight to on one hand, Express and to ocean freight. And as much as we have had challenges last year with regard to air freight we benefited on the Express side to a certain extent and a little bit as well on the ocean side.
So that's what we see currently. We have not more insight in this than the market overall has. So it's very much dependant on the overall economic development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen Furlong,  Davy Research - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay that's great, thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next question comes from Mark McVicar from Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Nomura - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Frank, hi Larry. Two or three questions from me, first of all on the dividend which is obviously quite important today.  Are we to take what you said as meaning that you've now rebased it back to the middle of the range and therefore it should start to grow again from '13 onwards as net profit grows?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, let me take that one. I think you have to go back to the last couple of years and ask why we were at the very high end of our policy range. And it was most of all to demonstrate to you outside the Company the confidence that we had in our strategy and in the changes that we were making in the Company which were not always as visible a couple of years ago as they might be today.
So, I think you should see the dividend recommendation today as a step toward normalization. We are still in the upper half of the range. But absolutely we would expect further dividend progression in the future as we continue to increase income in line with our mid-term forecast.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Nomura - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thank you. Next question was central costs obviously were up a bit in the year and you're still happy that these will be down at EUR350m by 2015, but it's just a bit more tail-end loaded yes?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, let me take that one too. One of the main reasons that the Corporate Center costs had increased this year is related to our stock-based compensation program which is a cash program. And so we had more costs than we had forecast at the beginning of the year, as we in effect mark to market. And the significant increase that we had in our share price meant that we had more cost for that program. Otherwise we were very much on target with our costs. And, yes, it is very much still our intention to be at EUR350m or below by 2015.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Nomura - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, that's great. Next question, obviously the tax rate was much lower than you had expected at the start of the year. What should we be using for the purposes of modeling for the next couple of years?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, with (multiple speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Nomura - Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I know it's a difficult one because there's a lot of moving parts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After having given guidance last -- the last two years that ended up being much higher than what the rate ended up being we are reluctant to give guidance again this year. We -- to be conservative we don't figure in further activation of tax loss carry-forwards which after the last two years' experience, one might view as extremely conservative nevertheless we don't do it, and therefore we probably would go back to a rate of around 27% but with some upside potential based on our ability to further utilize tax loss carry-forwards or activate tax loss carry-forwards.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Nomura - Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thank you. And one more quick last question.  Could you just remind us what the cost of, the final cash costs of the US restructuring are going on? And how much more we can expect until it's actually a completed program?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me take the last part first. We have still around EUR500m of provisions left related to the US restructuring, which potentially could stretch out over a number of years. There's in particular some real estate matters where it just made sense or was impossible to get out of the obligations and so we are stuck with those for some years. But we should start to see a downward trend in the amount of the cash cost each year. So in terms of the total cash amount let me come back to you on that in just a minute.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Nomura - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. That's great, thank you very much.

The next question is from Wenchang Ma from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wenchang Ma,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. My first question is about Mail. So given the full-year '12 actual and expected 2013 Mail EBIT level, would you consider the existing 2015 guidance of EUR1b to be conservative?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me say the following, we have worked hard on last year's numbers and we are very happy that we were about EUR1.2b if you exclude the VAT. We have a price increase now but we also will have soon negotiations with the unions about salary adjustments going forward. The decline of Mail volumes is still continuing, and as long as we do not see really a fundamental change in the trend that means we see growth of the top line again, I would be cautious to commit now and say that's a conservative.
I think two years ago the market was not convinced that we can stabilize above EUR1b. We have now demonstrated that in three consecutive years. I would keep it at the moment as -- that's definitely our target and we will see in due course how much we really can grow the top line again. And that is linked to many aspects like the German economy, the fundamental trend of Parcels and also the decline of Mail. So I would refuse to say that this is the conservative. I think that's what we always have promised and we would like to stick to that for the time being.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wenchang Ma,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay thank you. And also the second question on Express, could you comment a little bit on the volume and the yield trend in Europe for Express please?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I don't know the volumes by heart. I don't know, Larry, if we have the volumes. What we can say is that we have seen volume growth in Europe despite the fact that some economies have been weak. We think that is mainly driven by the trading is still developing better than domestic GDP even in the Southern European countries. And in addition we believe that we have gained market share, but we can maybe probably in the data we provide usually, this should be included as well or it's not?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And typically for competitive reasons we are not giving exact figures by region for Express. We did have positive growth and we believe that we gained share in Europe last year as well as the year before. But more precise than that we don't want to be.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wenchang Ma,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay that's all right. And then finally on the Forwarding side is it possible to comment on how much was the NFE implementation cost in 2012? And how was it spread by quarter please? Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Without being very precise on the spread by quarter it was reasonably well spread throughout the four quarters of the year. The investment in 2012 was in the high double-digit million range.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wenchang Ma,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So you would say for 2013 it would be similar amount, is that right?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, it will be an incremental increase again in the high double-digit range.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next question is from Damian Brewer, RBC. Please go ahead with your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Three questions, and let me give them to you all at once. First of all on the TDI side, the quarter-on-quarter development there in the fourth quarter is the strongest I think we've seen for about six years. Could you give us some idea of what drove that? It looks particularly impressive just from that seasonal impact, and how much that sort of strong demand has had on the ability of the rate increase put in in January to fully stick?
Then secondly, you mentioned trading down from air to ocean on the Forwarding side and also to Express.  With your account management do you have a feel for how much of that trading down is still being captured within the Group, i.e., revenue out of one division is being picked up in another, and how much that's sticky?
And then very finally on the tax rate, do you have a feel for how much or what level the unutilized tax losses sit at, at the moment? And other than simple profitability is there anything else that could trigger their utilization?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So let me take the two first, so the -- you're right it was a very strong growth and I think that has two main -- or the real fundamental reason behind that is that our service quality was better than ever before globally last year. And we are convinced that the strategy Ken Allen has led all of his team to focus on the international product and to train our people very carefully in line with that product has paid off significantly.
So it's a mixture of underlying growth. It's -- and there is more and more growth from B2C premium product. And there is gain of market share from our competitors. And therefore we have seen a very strong development in the last quarter, and we are optimistic that we can continue because our service quality is great.
How much we really capture in the Group is very difficult to assess because despite that we have some large customers, and it's very difficult to judge from our side how much was really kept and how much was moving on to others because there are so many customers who are not easily tracked from in a separate organization. So I would say it's probably difficult to really judge how much we really have captured in the group.
But if I see the development of TDI, if there is movement as we believe, we probably have captured quite a bit otherwise the strong growth has not been possible.
With that Larry may comment on the tax.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the amount of tax loss carry-forwards not yet activated remain in the billions of euros and almost all of it is in Germany, about two-thirds; in the US, about one-third. The primary factor that will allow us to do further activation is indeed improved performance. That is the single best way to be able to utilize more of those net loss carry-forwards.
There may be other ways, i.e., restructurings that we might be able to do, but we don't count on anything and don't really have any specific plan in that direction. So that we would rely on improved performance to allow us to activate more of those NOLs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Can you just, coming back on one question. Just the rate increases in Express put in the beginning of this year. How well have those stuck?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think it's too early to really make a definitive comment about those. In particular, we've had the Chinese New Year in between and I think it would be too early to really make a definitive statement about those.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [34]

Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sorry I just wanted to come back to Mark McVicar's question on the total cost of the US restructuring. Since we started to book it in 2008 it is EUR2.7b, again around EUR500m are left as provisions.

The next question is from Andy Chu, Deutsche Bank, London. Please go ahead with your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andy Chu,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks very much. Good afternoon Frank, Larry and Martin. Two questions if I may. Firstly, Frank, I wonder if it is possible to give us some flavor of current trading. I guess it's early on in the year, but we're two months in. Maybe some sort of commentary around TDI volume growth and Parcels.
Then secondly on supply chain, a nice improvement in margin on it. I just wondered if there was any reversal there in terms of capital intensity of contracts because clearly it's a balance between capital and being an asset light and whether some of that margin improvement is actually coming at the expense of being a little bit more capital intensive within supply chain. Thanks very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so the year has just started. I think it would be fair after release the guidance for this year that the year has started so far in line with our expectations. Otherwise we have not given that type of guidance. And beyond that, I think it's too early to say because there are some special items like we have a stamp price increase, we had Chinese New Year later than last year and we had one working day more in January. I think it's too early to really comment beyond what I have just said.
I would not say that the  -- the increase in margin is related to more capital. I think it's really more related to the willingness of customers to pay for great service and high quality. So I think that's more the fundamental trend we see around the world. But even in the emerging markets, I've visited just recently, Thailand for instance, and I saw there as well we have good development with margin improvements without putting more capital behind that. So I would not say that this is the driver. Capital is not the driver. It's our own performance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andy Chu,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank, can I just ask you in terms of Parcel volume growth and I've just seen comments from the press which may be secondhand that are coming to me, but comments over some maybe tempering expectations on Parcel volume growth. Yet the company has delivered that 10% volume growth in Q4. I know it's only one quarter.  It is an acceleration versus Q3. So maybe you could maybe clarify if there is any clarification to be made just sort of outlook for the Parcels business please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I only repeated what we have shared with you until 2020 at the Capital Market Day where we said it's 5% to 7% underlying market growth. And that's the basis.  So we have not changed our mind on that. Of course, we should always strive to further growth but I think for saying and my statement was until 2020 to say that business will grow double digit until 2020 I think that would be, in 2013, by far too broad a statement and therefore I kept the statement on the level we gave you in the Capital Market.
Can we grow faster at the shorter end? We have just demonstrated that in the fourth quarter and of course we will work hard to continue. But that's too early to say if it's possible in 2013 again. So my statement was not for 2013 in particular; it was more related to what we expect until 2020 for this market.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe I'll just add to that. The 5% to 7% is not just our forecast it's the forecast of several external groups who have a lot of insight from different angles to that market. Our experience the last couple of years has in fact been better than that. We're very pleased about that. We believe the market has grown faster and we may have gained just a little bit of share but it's primarily been market growth.
Should we see categories especially in FMCG, fast-moving consumer goods, like groceries, druggery items, begin to take major share then we might revise our growth forecast upwards. But we think it's just too early to do that yet.

Your next question is from David Ross from Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes good afternoon, gentlemen. Could you comment on the Express lane strength? Was it Asia exports to the US that were the strongest growing or was it Asia-Europe, Europe export? Any color there would be appreciated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have been surprisingly in percentage terms, growing the fastest in the Americas. We are having tremendous success with the international business focus in the US as well as in the rest of the Americas. We continue to have really good growth in Asia and other emerging markets like Africa Middle East but the one growing the very fastest is the Americas.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then I guess same color on the forwarding side, whether it be air or ocean freight. Are there lanes that stand out as being the strongest or weakest performers in the quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just focusing on Q4, so the Asian lanes started to pick up towards the end of the quarter. Although again we saw continued negative growth in air freight, it was lower negative growth than we had seen in the previous quarter so if you could call that encouraging, it was. Although we start to compare to some soft comparisons already at the end of 2011. So, yes, if you could say any lanes were stronger than the rest, probably started to see some strength out of Asia towards the end of the year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because we saw actually positive air freight growth from Asia to the US in the quarter so maybe Asia to Europe was a little bit weaker to offset that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I think we would refrain from commenting on specific lanes for competitive reasons.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The last question is just on the European package and freight market. After the TNT/UPS merger fell apart, what do you see is the new competitive dynamic there? Have things changed materially? Are any of the market share gains that you won when all of that was going on, gone back to the former carriers?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So we have not seen -- if I, it's too early to say for this year because you know that decision came only in January. So the impact is definitely not visible yet in the numbers. In the fourth quarter we still had the same trend as you can see from the reported numbers that we gained market share.
I think it's too early. We don't expect that you might be concerned about a price war. We have no indication that this is taking place. TNT still have to consolidate their activities and they are doing that but we have not seen a very heated competitive landscape currently, but that's too early to say because the announcement was only mid-January.

The next question comes from Julia Winarso from HSBC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head, IR    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Julia.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Julia Winarso,  HSBC - Analyst    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Can we just go back to slide 20? I've got a couple of questions on this. The first one is if you look at the changes in provisions, we have EUR301m from pensions. The additional EUR300m, can you clarify exactly what that is and whether we should expect that on an ongoing basis?
Then on the changes in working capital, and others. I understand around EUR400m of that is working capital. So what is the others and again, should we expect an additional EUR200m on an ongoing basis there?
I've got one other question as well that I'll come back to after that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so, in the EUR600m you're right. By far the single biggest item is the pensions. The next biggest or next important item is other employee programs like early retirement, partial retirement programs. The remainder are a collection of smaller items. I would say that, if anything, they would tend to trend down over time. But I say that without a huge amount of conviction.
The same thing with the others, including changes in working capital. It's really a collection of a whole number of small items, I would say the likely -- they are more likely to trend down than up, but it's hard to predict on a year-to-year basis.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Julia Winarso,  HSBC - Analyst    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay thank you. One other question. Just on your guidance the EUR2.7b to EUR2.95b EBIT. Can you give any sort of indication on the DHL side what kind of revenue growth you are premising that on by division?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, we usually don't give revenue targets as you might remember from the last years and therefore we will not do that. What we can say is of course we will achieve the lower end of that guidance if the markets are very weak. And if we see good trends during the year and improvement of the economy then we should get closer to the upper end. So I think that at the moment that's the reason why we gave you a rather broad range because the uncertainty is still pretty high.
We usually refrain from giving top-line targets in addition to our bottom-line targets because of course we are very much focused in particular in areas like supply chain and air freight that we are not focusing on making revenue targets but profitability. And not always a significant new contract leads to significant improvement of the bottom line. And therefore we usually don't steer through the top-line growth despite the fact that we want to gain market share in all divisions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Julia Winarso,  HSBC - Analyst    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, that's lovely thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so maybe something that could be helpful in that regard is not our revenue projections but our underlying assumption about the overall economy. And there we see 2013 likely to be again a below average year in total. With some chance that we'll see some improving trends throughout the year with the second half being better than the first half. Overall, we see a global real GDP growth in the range of 2.5% to 3%. So similar to what we saw overall for 2012.

The next question comes from Neil Glynn from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neil Glynn,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, everybody. First of all if I could ask a question with respect to Mail, I appreciate labor negotiations are ongoing which will impact the costs on the staffing front. But can you give us an indication as to what level of headcount 2013 guidance is based on. I trust the headcount should fall slightly.
Second of all, an update on the Shanghai hub seven months after its opening would be helpful. Interested in terms of how it's developing in terms of customer accretion, and how it's performing relative to other major hubs.
Then one final one on Supply Chain, it's obviously quite a heavily consumer-focused company exposed division. How do you view credit quality there? Are there any issues across the broad customer base that concern you?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Mail, Larry, you answer the last question. First, the performance of the hub is -- we have a very good performance. I think we have - we are not commenting exactly about the performance of these integral hubs with regard to customers because that's just a part of the global performance and this is a significant part of that and to say the growth we have seen in the fourth quarter is linked just to that activity is probably not appropriate. Because of course we have invested significantly around the world in other places too. So therefore we usually refrain from linking growth and winning new customers just to one activity. Of course we have improved our cut-off time through that. The performance of the hub was very good through the last quarter.
With regard to the development of headcount, we don't have that goal as an internal goal. We are looking to cost development and productivity and therefore we optimize continuously independent of what the growth in Parcel is and the decline in Mail. Therefore we are not steering from a certain headcount reduction, what we are doing is we have measures in place to optimize our productivity. That should help us to deliver the guidance we have given. And beyond that we don't disclose that detail. Maybe with that Larry you can comment on our process to manage the credit risk of small customer chain.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so in Supply Chain as in other divisions, we are doing an extensive credit review process for any new contract that we enter into. In some ways for supply chain it's even more critical than our other businesses because the contracts are medium and long term. It can happen that the credit -- that we enter into a contract with a healthy customer that runs into financial difficulty at some point during the contract and then it becomes a risk.
We saw that a couple of years ago with Arcandor an especially big example of that. The good news is that we don't see anything out on the horizon that remotely looks like an Arcandor-sized case. Again, we think we've tightened up the credit review process even over the last couple of years. We really haven't experienced anything similar since 2010.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And if you look into the past, particularly related to US customers, which are huge customers of us. If they go into Chapter 11, we are always perceived as a mission critical supplier. Therefore we are preferred paid. Therefore we had very little impact from some of the Chapter 11 activities in the last years. That comes with our services and therefore we are credit protected when some other suppliers or companies go into Chapter 11.
That doesn't protect us completely and therefore what Larry said, it's important that we revisit that continuously was we do. But we also have a slight advantage over other industries who are supplying to some companies who are in Chapter 11.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head, IR    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And as we highlighted in our workshops on Contract Lifecycle management, of course, the issue is one of the hard criteria before entering any new contract for relations. Okay Neil, that's going to be good enough for you?
Neil Glynn6 That's great, thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next question comes from Robin Byde of Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robin Byde,  Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robin Byde from Cantor Fitzgerald. Good afternoon, guys. Just on supply chain, on that profit margin is 3% the new normal? Could it go higher and what might drive a higher margin? For example, would that be more life sciences contracts versus fewer automotive consumer contracts? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So it's obviously a good question what is the new normal there? Because you know in Supply Chain the return on sales is the most tricky one. Because we have in some cases we have huge pass-through revenue which dilutes that. Or we have negative working capital with low margins as well. I think at the end of the day we believe we can improve the margin further but the key focus is really on on-boarding profitable business which has higher profitability than the current business.
And as Martin already said, these contract life cycle activities should help us as well to protect the margins more. At the end of the day what counts here to grow the top line in the -- with a faster speed without creating new risk. Some of our competitors are growing faster, but creating continuously higher risk.
So we are very much focused on absolute profitability and less of a margin, because the margin is a little bit the result of the split of industries. But I have no doubt that there is more margin improvement possible and we should see that.
It takes quite a while because if we replace customers every three or five years it takes some time to see the impact of new higher margin wins in the numbers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robin Byde,  Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can I just come back (multiple speakers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe without giving any specific margin target, you know that it's our intention to grow operating earnings 13% to 15% per year. We would expect that to be a higher growth rate than revenues, implying that we would expect some increase in margins from here at least to 2015. And you're exactly right, I think it goes back to our solutions expertise, our ability to continue to add more and more value to customers and that's what we're concentrating on.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Joynson,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, good afternoon, Frank, Larry, Martin. I've got three questions please. I'd like to take them one by one. First of all just on translation or FX issues. With a large share of DHL profitability coming from outside of the euro zone, could you may be provide some color on how much of a benefit the weak euro provided the DHL EBITS in 2012. And potentially how much of a headwind that could provide or the stronger euro could provide in 2013 if exchange rates remain where they are.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. So for the size and breadth of our company, it is -- it turns out to be surprising how well balanced we are in terms of net exposure. And so, yes, in 2012 we had some benefit. We also do some hedging activities and so the net amount of benefit for the whole company ended up being in the low double digit million range.
And so within a reasonable range of expectations for 2013, even though you're exactly right that it's kind of turned around, at least at the beginning of the year and headed in the opposite direction we would expect not to be dramatic at all for this year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Joynson,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Then just a question on cash conversion. Just on the color -- some color please on the extent to which the non-cash provision benefits are actually factored into the 2015 EBIT guidance. For example, if we go back slide 20 which Julia mentioned before. I was just wondering if you'd provide some color on what the change in provisions number could look like for 2015.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I think we would hesitate to give a specific forecast. What we've said is that we would expect the pension figure to slowly go down from the EUR301m level that we had in 2012 as the population of retirees tends to slowly decline over time and not in the slide on page 20 because we removed it as a non-recurring effect, restructuring cash of EUR140m we would expect to go down as well by 2015.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Joynson,  Macquarie Research - Analyst    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. Then just the final question, it's a bit of a technical question actually related to the Mail guidance and the impact of revised IAS 19. Now in 2012 I think I'm right to say that Mail EBIT was depressed by a charge related to the amortization of unrealized pension losses, which I assume is around about EUR50m. But that won't impact EBIT in 2013 because of the accounting changes caused by revised IAS 19. Am I looking at that in the correct way or am I missing anything there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You're looking at at least half of it in the correct way. You're pretty much right about your assumption of 2012 and you're right that we will avoid the amortization of those unrecognized losses as we were doing before the introduction of the new standard. However, offsetting that will be the increased service cost if discount rates remain at the current low levels that we will have. So that we expect those two effects to pretty much offset each other and for the net effect to be close to neutral on the EBIT level.
Again we expect the significant positive effect on financial expense both from the funding we've done at the end of last year, but also from the lower discount rates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim Marshall,  Redburn Partners - Analyst    [90]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, everyone. In Express you reported a 10% increase in the underlying EBIT for the year. The revenue was up by about EUR1.1b and then materials, staff and depreciation combined for a EUR1.2b increase. So all the profit growth came from a reduction of about EUR200m in the net Other operating expenses. I think almost all of that came in the second half of the year. Can you just talk through what's in that number and what we should be expecting it to be in FY13?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, it's Peter Hyde actually but a couple of questions. Firstly you talked, I think about a factor cost increase in the Mail business and I just wondered if you could explain that.
Secondly in Express, I was interested in any comments you're willing to make by region. I know you don't disclose anymore, but are there any regions where margins actually went backwards in 2012? And/or could you comment on the spread of margins between different regions?
Then finally on Express the third question, when you talk about investment for quality of service, do you think you're at the end of that at the moment? Or could you just give me some sort of timeframe as to where you've been and where you think you're going and whether you've got the level of quality of service you want to drive at. Because it sort of seems to me that that's quite clearly one of the benefits or you're beginning to report some of those benefits of improved quality of service in your EBIT. Thanks.

So on the first question on the factor cost increase. The one that we know is in the first quarter of the year. We have a 4% increase in labor costs compared to last year because the new tariff agreement, labor agreement that started last year started on April 1. So for the first quarter it is a 4% difference. After that it is subject to the current negotiations that we'll be entering into with the union in the very near future for determining what that increase will be for the remainder -- the remaining three quarters of the year.
So on the second question, in terms of region profitability and differences by region, again we don't disclose that for competitive reasons and we think of the Express business anyway as very much a global network business and of course there's differences from country to country and region to region. But sometimes they are not that meaningful and again for competitive reasons we prefer not to be any more specific about differences between regions.
So can we express service -- can we increase service levels further in Express? We absolutely can and continue to have that as a goal. We've done a great job. We ourselves have measured that but external organizations have also measured it and we've achieved some significant strides and overall customer service levels, but it is our belief that our intention to increase further and actually continuously improve over time.

The next question comes from Joel Spungin from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joel Spungin,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [98]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi there, guys. Actually my question was actually related to I think Tim's question earlier regarding the cost movement in Express. And just following on from that, whether that's the sort of drop through that you would expect in terms of volume leverage going forward in that division. I know you obviously commented that you would expect the margin to improve in 2013. So that was question one.
Question two, I'm afraid I'm back on this working capital issue. Larry, I think you said that the underlying performance was not as good as you'd hoped it to be. And following on from Julia's comment about EUR400m trade working capital movement in there, could you just sort of try and quantify what the movement has been in terms of days outstanding on either payables or receivables. And whether going forward I think you said you expected to grow with the business. Just trying to reconcile you saying it's an unsatisfactory performance in 2012 with growing with the business going forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [99]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I think actually our overall and average working capital performance in terms of VSOs and DPOs has actually been quite good for all of our divisions. It has remained constant to having slightly decreased in some areas.
What was disappointing was the movement on payables that we had between the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012. In effect, we overemphasized the cash flow generation in 2011 to the detriment of 2012. So that's something that was much less accentuated between the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013. That's the kind of trend we would expect to continue over time. So you don't have such huge movements between the years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joel Spungin,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [100]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay fine. So just to be clear. Would you expect the working capital volatility that we saw in 2012 where it was very volatile over the course of the year to be less so this year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [101]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would tend to think that there will be a decrease in overall volatility over the quarters of the years and from year to year going forward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joel Spungin,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [102]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. I don't know if you've had a chance to look it up, but if you've got any comment on the cost development in Express.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [103]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So one of the things that is playing a significant role is the release of this provision that we had in the year. And so that is probably the biggest factor in the movement between the different cost categories from quarter to quarter and year to year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joel Spungin,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [104]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay and going forward is there anything that you can say in terms of leverage?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [105]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
May I say, so definitely the investment into the network will be this year significantly smaller than in the last years. Particularly until last summer. We have brought much more wide-bodies in to the system. So we should, despite that we have good virtualization of these airplanes we should get, if the volume development continues, we should see good leverage because replacing air freight by core products should help us to improve the margins.
You might remember at the Capital Market Day, Ken said that, that last year was the target to gain market share and this year is the year for margin expansion. That is one key driver behind that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joel Spungin,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [106]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [107]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You're welcome. Thanks, Joel. Operator, do we have any more questions out there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [108]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, there are no further questions left.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head, IR    [109]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, well, then that brings us to the end of this call. Well inside the 90 minute mark.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [110]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me summarize. I think we delivered as promised to the market the numbers for 2012. We are very committed to improve our EBIT numbers this year again to make one step into the direction of our mid-term target 2015.
We understand that there is a need for improved free cash flow generation further and we are very committed to do that, that's the reason why we brought for the first time a target on free cash flow to the market. And we will push that very hard into the organization after we have done other stuff before. And I am confident that we will see the input of those activities more in 2013. We saw already some of that in the second half of 2012. So we are very committed to continuing our growth path on the top line as much as the bottom line.
With that, I would like to thank you for listening this afternoon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head, IR    [111]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you and bye bye.
