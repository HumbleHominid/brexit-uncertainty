Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Kraft Foods Group financial update. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. 
(Operator Instructions) 
As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Chris Jakubik, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - VP of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. With me today are Tony Vernon, our CEO, and Tim McLevish, our CFO. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. Those statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, so please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our press release and Form 10 filing for more details on our forward-looking statements. 
We'll also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our press release, our slides, and in the IR Section of KraftFoodsGroup.com. 
Before we start, I'd like to say a few words on the basis of the financial contained in our press release issued earlier today. As we discussed in our third-quarter conference call last November, our Q4 2011 financials are on a carve-out basis, whereas our Q4 2012 financials reflect our standalone cost structure, so there are limitations in terms of assessing our performance on a year-over-year basis. In addition, please note that due to the fact that we are still in the process of implementing the change in our post-employment benefit strategy, we are not yet at a point where we have finalized the allocation of 2012 post-employment benefit expenses between cost of goods sold and SG&A, nor the allocation of those costs on a business segment basis. Those details will be included, along with the full set of our final and audited financials, within our 10-K, which we expect to file no later than March 29. So with that, I'll turn it over to Tony. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Chris. First I'd like to say that the fourth quarter was one of real progress, and some significant disappointment. We made great strides in productivity, profit, and cash, but we really missed our top line. At the same time, as Tim and I parse through the key drivers of our performance, we think you'll see why we feel very good about the solid foundation we laid for the future of the new Kraft. As the slide says, Kraft made 1903, remade 2012, and we believe we are well-positioned to deliver profitable growth in 2013 and beyond. 
Now, let's start by taking the revenue miss head on. On a reported basis, our fourth quarter revenue was down 10.7%. On an organic basis, revenue was down about 7%. So, what happened? Well, we were lapping an historic high of 9.2%  reported growth in Q4 2011, and within that 9.2%, was lapping an unprecedented 7.8% organic growth. As you know, we also shifted growth into the third quarter last year related to the spin-off, and that was about half of the 6.8% negative impact from trade inventory reductions in our fourth quarter. 
In addition, we experienced a higher year-end drawdown of inventories by a few key retailers that we didn't anticipate. Now, in normal course, strong consumption would be enough to offset year-end retail inventory changes. Unfortunately, our efforts to rein inefficient trade promotion spending took a bigger bite out of revenues in the fourth quarter. And you can see in the slide that our consumption slowed in Q4 versus the full year. 
Here's why. While we were taking out inefficient trade spending all year long, one of our biggest customers was ramping up its return to an Every Day Low Price or EDLP strategy. As a result, we didn't have strong enough offerings in some key categories during the December holiday push, and our consumption was softer than we anticipated. This served to exacerbate an already significant impact from trade inventory levels at the end of the third quarter. That said, there's no question that taking out inefficient trade spending is the right thing to do. In fact, our overall market share performance has continued to be solid, and our three outlets share in Q4 was the strongest that it's been in recent history. 
At the same time, we recognize that if we expect to grow at or above the North American food and beverage industry, we have to do it across the majority of our biggest customers, and we are confident we have the right advertising, innovation and go-to-market programming to grow profitably, without the need for reinstating inefficient trade spend. 
Beyond the topline, we really liked what we saw on the cost and cash sides of the equation. We delivered record net productivity in both the fourth quarter and for the full-year 2012, and as our efforts to build a leaner, focused organization are coming through, our overhead savings are beginning to show up in our P&L. These two factors not only had a positive impact on how to 2012 results, they enabled us to do what we said we're going to do. That is, keep investing in our brands and innovation and deliver significant cash flow. 
In fact, our advertising for the full year was up over 20%. It was up even more than that in the fourth quarter, and we ended the year with a cash balance of about $1.3 billion. More importantly, we left 2012 in a much improved position to deliver the consistent profitable growth both you and we expect from the new Kraft. Despite the large Q4 impact from retail inventory reductions, we left the year with retail inventory at normal levels by historical standards. Our marketing playbook, with top-tier innovation, and good-better-best products and pricing is working. We see it in the fact that our percentage of sales from innovation is going up, our good-better-best strategy is working, evidenced by a strong three outlets share performance, and that our progress in those areas is spreading to even more of our categories. 
But the best proof of the new Kraft playbook is the continued growth in some of our iconic brands. Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, up 11% in 2012. Our VELVEETA franchise, up 12%.  MiO in year two of its launch, with private label competitors, up 67%. And the cheese and dairy business unit delivered its best performance in over a decade on all key financial and share measures. And by the way, the average market share of all these brands is over 60%. 
Also, further benefits from rolling out our productivity and cash management tools across the organization are still ahead of us. And with today's announcement of our comprehensive strategy to address our post-employment benefit obligations, we're taking significant steps to improve the financial transparency of our results, and the predictability of our future cash flow. We are on the road to deliver the potential of the best brand portfolio in the industry. But, as I've told you before, this is a marathon, not a sprint. Our fundamentals are sound, and we like how we're positioned for 2013. 
Now, I'm going to turn it over to Tim, who will do the yeoman's work today in providing more details on our financial results and our financial future. Given all the moving parts that entered the picture in our fourth quarter, the numbers we reported today are probably a little messy and difficult to wade through, so today, Tim is going to go into a little more detail than we typically would. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - EVP & CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Tony, and good morning and thank you all for joining us at this early hour as we walk through our 2012 results, which are admittedly complex. Before we dive into the numbers for Q4 and full-year 2012, and what to expect as we head into 2013, I'd like to take some time to discuss the other important announcement we made today, the implementation of our new post-employment benefit strategy. I'm sure you're wondering just what we're doing and why. 
Here's the story. The Company split provided us the opportunity to reevaluate how to better manage expenses and cash outlays related to our post-employment benefit obligations. A revaluation made a lot of sense given that the nature of these liabilities for the new Kraft is quite different than it was pre-split. Our post-employment liabilities are now much larger as a percent of our balance sheet, and the population covered by our plans has a higher percentage of retirees or a shorter liability duration. This is due to the inclusion of the Mondelez retirees in the United States that we assumed as part of our separation agreement. Under the old strategy, potential volatility presented a significant risk to our goal of delivering consistent growth in profits and cash flow. We believe our new strategy will be a significant improvement for our shareholders. 
The strategy we're executing has four elements. First, we're moving to mark-to-market accounting for post-employment benefit obligations. This has the impact of lowering our ongoing post-employment benefit expenses by eliminating the amortization of unrecognized deferred costs. We'll then review the liability in the fourth quarter each year, and record any mark-to-market adjustments necessary. Please note that the first of these entries was made as part of our 2012 results, that I'll cover in a few minutes. The entry we record in the fourth quarter for each year will reside outside of segment operating income, and will be identified separately to reflect the pure mark-to-market impacts. 
Second, we are making a one-time adjustment to the actuarial assumptions we used to value plan obligations. Specifically, we've adjusted retirement, mortality and medical cost trend rates, to reflect the expanded population now covered under our plans. On its own, adjusting the actuarial assumptions as I've described will increase ongoing expenses, but we expect it will reduce expense volatility over time. Third, we're phasing in a liability-driven investment mix in our pension plans.  We will do this by migrating from a roughly 30%-70% fixed income to equity mix to about an 80% fixed income 20% equity mix over the next several years. As a result, we'll be adopting a more conservative end state expected return on asset assumption of approximately 5.5%, down from 7.75% previously. 
And finally, we are executing a level funding strategy for our pension obligations. We plan to make a $600 million contribution in 2013. Since we generated significant cash in 2012 and ended the year with almost $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet, funding this will not be a problem. Going forward, our strategy is to make level funding contributions of approximately $225 million annually. Our strong cash generation will be more than enough to provide for this. 
So what are the benefits of the new strategy? There are several that I believe are worth mentioning. First, we believe these changes will result in a more consistent and predictable financial profile. Our ongoing post-employment benefit obligations will be less sensitive to changes in discount rates. And there will be greater transparency to market-based impacts on the size of our liabilities. In addition, the strategy strengthens the alignment between our cash flow and expenses in a manner that should reduce the volatility of cash contributions to plans going forward. 
Lastly, our investment strategy will bring plan assets and liabilities into better alignment, specifically, we're migrating the asset mix of the plans such that plan assets and plan obligations will fluctuate in tandem. And I would note that this investment strategy will neither affect our debt covenants nor our ability to continually grow our dividend. These changes will not only affect our reported financials going forward, but will also require an adjustment to our historical financials. As stated in our press release, our full set of audited updated historical financials will be issued in our 10-K filing by the end of March. At the same time, we wanted to provide you with as much of a financial update as we could, as soon as we could. 
So let's start with our Q4 and 2012 results. As we've discussed before, Q4 was the first period to reflect our independent cost structure, and transition to a stand-alone entity. And there's literally a laundry list of puts and takes versus prior year carve-out financials. It does include the mark-to-market entry for the post-employment benefit plans that I talked about earlier. I will caveat that these are still unaudited numbers, and there remains some potential for tweaking between now and when we file our 10-K. 
I'm not going to go through each item, because that would take the rest of the hour. Instead, I'll focus on the two lines that I believe matter most, and that with the largest impact on our 2013 performance. The first is our earnings from operations. $0.15 in Q4 and $0.33 for the year. Q4 saw the impact of the ongoing favorability from the change in our post-employment benefit accounting, but we produced significant gains in productivity and overhead cost reductions in both Q4 and the full year. They offset a double-digit increase in advertising, and the impact of dissynergies from operating as a standalone company. 
The other line I'd highlight is restructuring. Specifically Q4 spending was lighter than we had expected by about $0.07 per share, due to the timing of a few projects. This change will mean that we'll have an additional $0.07 of restructuring program costs in 2013. This is purely a timing change, and not a change to our estimate of overall program costs of $650 million. 
So what does this all mean for 2013? As we indicated at our investor day and reiterated after Q3, we expect strong results in 2013. We anticipate EPS of approximately $2.75, compared to the $2.60 previously stated. The adjusted number reflects the $0.22 per share non-cash benefit from the switch to the new post-employment benefit accounting, and the negative impact from the restructuring program I just mentioned. For the year, we anticipate total restructuring program costs to be about $300 million or $0.33 per share, versus our previous call of approximately $240 million or $0.26 per share, and we continue to expect about $125 million in annual spending on cost-savings initiatives going forward after 2013. 
Our other assumptions remain unchanged from previous guidance. Organic revenue growth, in line with market growth, despite about 1 point of impact from product pruning. Continued strong gains from productivity and overhead cost reductions. Interest expense of approximately $520 million, and a tax rate of about 35%. And we continue to expect typical seasonality of quarterly sales and earnings, about 48% in the first half and 52% in the second half. 
So what is this going to look like on a year-over-year basis versus 2012? We expect to report $2.75 of diluted earnings per share for full-year 2012. We begin 2013 with the assumption that $0.24 mark-to-market impact to post-employment benefit plans that occurred in Q4 2012 will not repeat. And for the record, we have no means of predicting the pure mark-to-market impacts for 2013. We also know that the royalty income we received from Mondelez in 2012 stopped as of the spin-off date. 
Below the operating income line, we have several headwinds versus our Form 10 carve-out financials. Additional interest expense, a higher tax rate, and a few more shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis. Restructuring costs should be flat full-year 2013 compared to 2012, and that leaves gains from operations. In the end, we expect strong gains from operations to drive diluted EPS of approximately $2.75 in 2013. Where will this come from? A combination of profitable topline growth, productivity gains, and lower overhead costs, which well exceed the full year impact of dissynergies. 
Finally, a few words on cash, cash flow and liquidity and long-term growth. Given everything we've discussed so far today, you've heard us say that cash is king at the new Kraft and we're committed to delivering strong consistent free cash flow. There have also been some questions expressed regarding our expected cash generation in 2013, versus the size of our dividend. I'd like to put those questions to rest right now. As you can see from the chart, we plan to end 2013 as we began it, with a strong level of discretionary cash available, approximately $1 billion in the bank. And that's about $1 billion after we fund an annual dividend at the current rate of $2 per share. 
The other thing to note is that our free cash flow in 2013 is considerably tempered by a combination of three things. The $600 million pension contribution we've outlined earlier, a fifth tax payment of approximately $125 million that carried over from 2012, and $150 million in cash outlays for our restructuring program. As a result, we expect markedly higher free cash flow in 2014. But what about the long-term? Nothing we've outlined today has altered our expectations for long-term growth. We continue to expect profitable organic revenue growth at or above the market rate, consistent mid single-digit OI growth, consistent mid-to high single-digit EPS growth, and consistent mid-single digit dividend growth. I'll now turn it over to Tony for some closing remarks.

Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Tim. I hope we've done a good job of explaining all the moving parts of this quarter. Our fourth quarter was one of great progress, and setting the right foundation for 2013. We took an honored 110-year-old company and we gave it a fresh start. I see what it has done for our people, who are our competitive advantage. They're energized to remake this Company into what it truly has the potential to be, a North American powerhouse. 
I don't, for one minute, minimize the constant challenges we face, but I know what the newly remade Kraft is capable of doing. I see it firsthand every day, and I want you to see it as well. It is the early days. We've done a lot of good work, and there's still much work to be done, and we're off to a great start. Now, we'd like to answer your questions.

Questions and Answers

Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Operator Instructions) 
Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Please go ahead.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony, you'd mentioned that some of the reason for this greater-than-expected trade deload was in a key EDLP customer, you didn't have the right offerings. So I'm trying to get a sense of exactly what that means, because I'm not really understanding what led to that exactly. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Thanks, Andrew. You know what? The best thing I can do is contrast what happens when we hit the good-better-best playbook right, and when we don't. And I think that will give you an example of what happens in a key EDLP setting. To the positive, Mac & Cheese was challenged this year with a formidable entry from a significant industry player with a lower price on Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, our franchise $1 billion business. What we did to respond was take the full scale of the playbook which includes the lean Six Sigma low-cost producer advantages, the great innovation we have on that line, and put it in place as a competitive defense against a big entry. And what we saw is bonus packs, buy five get one free, a big increase in advertising, some great innovation, Mac & Cheese grows 11% in the year, in the face of a major entry from a competitor. 
On the other hand, Oscar Mayer, cold cuts, another $1 billion  business in a key franchise, we see a major 16 SKU entry from a major vertically-integrated meat player. We elected not to respond. We've got a great cold cut business that had been growing share and volume for three years. We looked, we stood pat with what we had, and we saw a major share loss in fourth quarter to this competitor. Those are the choices we make, as we roll out this playbook. In hindsight, I regret not responding on cold cuts exactly the way we responded on Mac & Cheese, but that's what happens in an EDLP setting. If you don't deliver on that first rung on the good-better-best ladder. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. That's helpful. Such a key tenet to this story and the way you have set up the structure going forward, has to do with, at a minimum, growing in line or better than your categories over time. And you talked a little bit about market share in the quarter, but I guess overall, it doesn't necessarily seem like that happened in the fourth quarter. Maybe you can give us a sense of however metrics make sense for you, whether it's the percent of the portfolio that are holding or gaining share, where you were in the fourth quarter, and more importantly, why that gets a whole lot better, obviously in 2013? And have you started to see the year shape up that way through whatever, middle of February? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. As far as market share, I think we're doing better, not where we should be overall, with a lot more left to do, very pleased with the three outlet shares, that hit a record high and are growing in the majority of our categories. Probably the best performance on market share in three outlet in almost a decade. And when we deliver on good-better-best, when we get the price points right, when the innovation comes together, our market share and our volume grows, and that's our obligation to our retailer. 
When we haven't, and you can look historically, bacon, block natural cheese, our volume and share performance suffers. Private label and third-tier brands are making some progress in categories in the industry, and they're filling the lowest rung in that good-better-best hierarchy, and they're just plain offering in some cases consumer better value. We can, with the Kraft portfolio and the breadth of the portfolio, deliver against that competitive threat. 
And I give you some examples. I will tell you we've put into place a market share modifier for the year to pay all of our marketing and sales teams, and frankly focus the whole organization on growing our share in the majority of our categories. That's our obligation to you as shareholders and to our customers, to beat their comps as the largest grocery player in the industry. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got it. Last thing for me. It doesn't appear to me that any of the shortfall in organic sales in the quarter had anything to do with the shift to your in-store merchandising effort, with Acosta and such, but I wanted to make sure that was, in fact, the case, or that I'm seeing in the right way. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think you are. Very pleased with Acosta and the in-store execution remains strong. They've actually been in place since second quarter. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
April or so. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plus the fact that our programming was significantly below last year, owing to some of this trade policy that I talked about. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks very much. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just a question going back to, I think it's slide 11, Tim, where you walked through the gains from operations in 2013, and just want to make sure I'm understanding, looking at the slide, it looks like a lot of the gains from operations, or most of them, are coming from the changes in pension accounting. Is that the right way to look at that, or am I just missing something as I look at this slide? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - EVP & CFO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actually, Bryan, quite to the contrary. I would say more than all of what you see as operations gains comes from real operational improvement. We have a number of offsets embedded within the $0.21 gain. The pension piece of it, the majority of the change in pension accounting took place in 2012. There is some incremental benefit from it. 
I would say it's somewhere in the $0.07 of that, but I will remind you that a full-year effect is about $0.10 headwind from dissynergy. We picked up about $0.05 worth of additional cost of associated the transferring over the liabilities of the Mondelez retirees. So really, you would be looking at a number significantly higher, if you looked at true effect from the benefit of our topline improvement, the productivity initiatives, the carry through of benefits from restructuring, including the overhead savings initiatives that we've deployed. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right. That's helpful. Just in terms of shifting in restructuring, some of the program moving from 2012 to 2013, does that affect at all the flow of savings flowing through for 2013? In terms of what you were expecting previously, to kind of drop through in 2013 is there any change in timing in that regard? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - EVP & CFO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not materially, Bryan. Maybe a tiny bit. Let me give you an example of one of the things that shifted. We sold our headquarters location, and leased it back, and the sale transaction was scheduled in late December, and we completed in early January, so that one in and of itself would have no impact. But it's things like that, so there's very modest if any delay in timing of the benefits. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. We'll see you in Florida next week.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel. Please go ahead.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the early press release this morning. That was great here in central time zone. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - VP of IR    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great for us too, Chris. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I know you know it well. Two quick questions for you. Tim, maybe you could help frame, the  liquidity  seemed to be clearly some better cost savings and productivity savings in the year, maybe as well as in the quarter. Can you help us understand how the productivity came in, and generally cost savings/overhead benefits came through? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - EVP & CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, actually our productivity exceeded our expectations. We continued to drive the Six Sigma improvements in overall productivity. Our overhead, we started that a good year ago, what we called Project Peak, and it also exceeded our expectations. Specifically from a liquidity in a cash position, we did have, as a result of what I just described, stronger cash, actually operating cash flow for the quarter and the year, but also some of the -- I would say probably half of the benefit from the cash flow standpoint and strong cash position was attributable to separation-related transfers from Mondelez. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then my other question was to confirm that in the fourth quarter, if you could frame the growth of your category? So what was your revenue growth in relation to those categories? A bit of a follow-on to Andrew's question,  was your share lower in the majority of your categories in the fourth quarter in your major categories? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Chris, so we trailed our objective of growing at or above our categories. We aren't going to publish that number on percent of categories flat or growing, but we trailed it by a level that was a give back to the first three quarters, when we were exceeding it. And has to do with some do with some of the dynamics I described. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Driscoll,  Citigroup - Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wanted to ask a little bit about the pension issue. I think you made an important statement, Tim, regarding the ongoing pension expense, that this would be a step up because of the some of the assumption changes. Can you give us an order of magnitude? What's the operating headwind that you will have to absorb because of this increase in the ongoing pension expenses? Can you start there, please? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - EVP & CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. It's all embedded within, there's a lot of moving parts in there. There's an effect from the change in the assumptions or the change in the investment strategy, and then there's the favorability from the accounting. It all gets wrapped up and is reflected in, what I said is probably $0.20, $0.25 worth of net improvements, most of which you saw come in 2012, some step up in 2013, but you should see about that level on an ongoing basis. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Driscoll,  Citigroup - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So my apologies. Let me try that one more time. What I was I was trying to do is, the part of the pension that you're not -- this benefit that you're getting is a good thing, makes your earnings go up. You talked about ongoing pension expense that you will report every quarter. 
It actually is a headwind in that expense sketch that goes higher, I believe you said that. And if you did, I was just trying to understand on the ongoing basis, it looks like it's a headwind every single quarter, not including the charges that you have excluded. There is an amortization issue that you exclude. I'm trying to not talk about that, just trying to talk about the expenses that go into the business segment. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - EVP & CFO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris will help me for a second. But when I made reference to -- there's actually two components of it that cost us more on an ongoing basis, and there's one that serves to our benefit. So the change in the pension accounting to mark-to-market serves to our benefit. The one that is a change in assumptions serves to our detriment, and it increases expenses. And the asset investment mix serves to our detriment. 
On balance, across all of those, there's a favorable impact that will be reflected on an annual basis, not the fourth quarter mark-to-market adjustment embedded in what we call our operating results, our operating income, will be a net benefit of some $0.20 to $0.25. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - VP of IR    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David, the way to look at it, what Tim was mentioning in terms of the year-on-year 2012 to 2013 $0.07 favorability from the post-employment accounting changes, that's what you're going to see show up on a quarterly basis. So the quarterly costs, the service costs et cetera that flow-through, as different from the year-end mark-to-market, it's going to be about $0.07 favorability from 2012 to 2013. You did see a lot of benefit of that in the fourth quarter. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Driscoll,  Citigroup - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. My final question was just on the trade issues. The 2.6 points that you called out in the third quarter, is it fair to say that when you talked about the fourth quarter de-load of 6.8 points, I should decompose this, and say that 2.6 of those points were the issue that you discussed in the third quarter and just a little bit more than 4 points of it, Tony, was related to this, so the trade reduction that was an unexpected issue that happened during the quarter? Is that accurate? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - VP of IR    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave, I think on the numbers there, the impact from the Q3 load onto Q4 was 3.4 so it's half of the 6.8. And then the rest of it were due to the other factors that Tony outlined. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - EVP & CFO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There was a little bit of build in the trade over the first and second quarter, as well. We popped up maybe a point. I don't know exactly what is in the first quarter, we did see, kind of at the Easter season, we did a little but again in the second quarters, the July 4th build, and then the big one was in the third quarter. So, the fourth quarter really brought all of that better into balance and we leave the year with trade inventories about normalized level.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ed Aaron,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You indicated a strong start to 2013, and I'm just trying to understand the extent to which that means you've already seen some recovery from the issue that you had in Q4. And also, to the extent that it does, is that because you made some tactical changes in areas where you got hit a little bit toward the end of the year, to drive better performance so far this year? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - EVP & CFO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. We're not going to get into -- we've said that our guidance policy is we're not going to get into quarterly guidance. I will point out that last year we had some price increases in the first quarter that we don't anticipate replicating again in the first quarter this year, so you'll probably see a little bit of press there. 
We still have a little bit of fixing of our offerings to do. So we may not see full recovery from the fourth-quarter consumption decline get fully fixed in the first quarter of the year, but overall, we feel strongly about the full-year 2013. We still hit expect to hit the growth algorithm that we've laid out. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - VP of IR    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think the other thing to add to it, as Tony mentioned in his opening comments, we ended the year with our trade inventories at normal levels, so I wouldn't expect much of a bounce back there in the first quarter. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ed Aaron,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [39]

Okay. Thanks. One other question if I could, has there been any real change to your inflation expectations for 2013?

Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - EVP & CFO    [40]

You probably see -- there's a little bit of movement in some of the commodities, but I will remind you that we're a lot better at managing input costs than we are at predicting them. We'll continue to monitor them and manage accordingly.

Robert Moskow,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't know if any clients read my 30-page pension report, but I guess maybe you did, and I appreciate it, if you did. But I guess my question is, did you consider taking a more radical step with how you did your pension liability and maybe even off-loading it to a third-party? Because it seems like in the negotiation with Mondelez, you got saddled with a lot, and that's done. But the problem with the pension liability is that equity investors don't get the benefit from the deleveraging. And if you had maybe taken a step like that, you could give people that kind of a benefit. And I wanted to know if it was even ever part of the consideration? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - EVP & CFO    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First of all I'll say thanks for writing your 30-page report. It was to those that read it, I think would be helpful in better understanding what we did and why we did it. I wasn't looking forward to a full-blown explanation of all of these things this early this morning, and I think that was helpful. 
So of course, we look at all the opportunities that we can find to create shareholder value, and we did, we have looked at exactly what you said. It is kind of a nascent market quite frankly, with insurance companies that will assume liabilities. There's been a few players. I think GM did it, not too long ago. 
The market historically has not priced so it made good economic sense. When the time comes, that I think the industry, the market evolves a bit, and the pricing comes back better into line and we think that it adds -- it generates a return consistent with our expectations for shareholders. We will look at it harder, and we are seeing that better coming into line as we go forward. So we'll continue to look at it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alexia Howard,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can I ask about the topline guidance? You're obviously guiding to growth in line with growth at North American food and beverage market levels, and to me that feels like a bit of a moving target. What metric are you using or tracking to measure that, and how fast did it grow in 2012 and how do you see the environment shaping up for overall North American food and beverage market growth in 2013? Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alexia, it is Tony, we expect market growth to consistently reflect consumption growth, in line with population growth, plus or minus input cost inflation. So this year, we would expect it's likely to be a little slower, because the industry now is comparing against some significant pricing over the course of 2012, and we haven't seen, except for a few categories any big inflation or commodity impacts. We think we are well-positioned to drive profitable growth in 2013, and we probably use exactly the same data you do to look in the rear view mirror, which is Nielsen Food and Beverage, we span so many categories, that we follow that food and beverage number four Nielsen by customer and by category.

Our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Goldman,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm a little confused about what you said. First of all, I very much appreciate the color as to why your sales disappointed where you thought they would be, but I'm not aware of any large customers that recently have shifted dramatically to an EDLP system. I know Walmart, a couple of years ago had made that shift back. So can you talk a little bit about, were you caught off-guard a bit? Did someone make a dramatic change in one of your categories? A little more help as to why perhaps you didn't see this coming, if that's the right way to phrase it, in terms of why it hurt your sales a little bit? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First thing I'd say is, I'll talk about the EDLP issue, but I would say there was a law of large numbers effect that we should have done a better job forecasting. Right? We don't expect to be up against a 10% comp lapping a 10% comp anytime soon. We don't expect that to be combined with a 53rd week and a significant safety stock build and we don't expect it to be combined with a third-quarter pull forward of fourth quarter sales, because we are executing a big change over. Those were the biggest factors. But I did want to point you to where our good-better-best strategy is working, and where it's got to be improved, because frankly I like that aligning shareholder objectives with my team's objectives. 
The EDLP factor is this. The moms at the lowest rung on the good-better-best ladder are strapped. And we and retailers are looking to grow volume in that group. They have a lot of kids, and the fact of the matter is retailers are looking to anybody that will give them a possible leg up, even if it might appear short-term and incremental, some of the introductions, and we've talked about this before -- some of the EDLP players have taken on totally new flankers and those flankers tend to play short-term havoc with key categories. 
In some cases it's big guys like us doing it. Right? We introduced a major new good-better-best platform behind VELVEETA skillets, and it upset the dinner aisle in a good way. It grew category, grew volume and incremental for retailers and I'm sure one of my competitors looked to respond, and probably that's why that competitor came after us in Mac & Cheese. So, it's more that playing to the lowest rung on the good-better-best ladder, and especially in EDLP players, who are targeting that mom who is looking to feed her family.

Our next question comes from Eric Katz man of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I guess, Tim, let's talk about page 12. Am I to understand then, given this, that you're dipping into your cash balance plus the $1 billion of free cash flow to fund the dividend, that all else being equal, your net debt will go up a bit, by the end of this year? Is that how I read that chart? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - EVP & CFO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. At the end of the day -- remember, the $1 billion includes an awful lot of one-time items we wouldn't expect to recur. There's $600 million of pension funding, there's $125 million of 2012 tax payment that we deferred into 2013, and restructuring that won't recur on a regular basis to this magnitude of $158 million. But simplistically, if you say net debt is gross debt minus cash in the bank, yes, we are using about $200 million worth of the cash balance to fund the dividend in this extraordinary year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then on the, this maybe a little bit of an unfair question, Tony, but from where you came, from Mondelez or Kraft, they're having trouble with their sales, and it sounds like in certain cases, on the Mondelez side, that there was excess shipments versus consumption, and now we're hearing the same thing from you. You're no longer responsible for that side, of what was Kraft, but why shouldn't we be concerned that KFT didn't, in broad-based terms, over ship consumption for good parts of 2012? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on Mondelez. And they're great brands, great people and wish them well. And let me talk about KFT. This quarter, after seven quarters of outperforming the market, volume consumption, top line, and margin, we definitely stubbed our toe this quarter. But the reality is, we don't manage this business on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We manage it for the long-term to grow at or above our categories, and feel quite good. 
I point to four key things though. When you look at going forward, innovation has doubled as a percent of our sales. Right? We continue to, I think,  perform at top-tier if not the best in the industry. Ad spending was up 20% on the year. I don't think you're going to see many competitors showing you that kind of investment in their equity. 
Overheads, we'll talk about at Cagney, but you know we have taken 25% to 30% out of Kraft overheads in two years, driving a lean and nimble culture. Net productivity, which was never a strength, is driving an all-time high and enabling this reinvestment in our brands, and our market share in three outlet is the best in recent history. I feel pretty good about those factors contributing to a long-term growth story. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - EVP & CFO    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will point out, Eric, that I said a couple minutes ago that over the first and second quarter as well as the big third-quarter separation build, that first quarter, probably as a result of Easter, this is not necessarily a KFT-driven initiative, but the retailers did -- there were shipments a little bit in excess of consumption, and in the second quarter as well, as they did a little bit of July 4th build more. 
So we actually -- the first quarter may have been their anticipation of the sales cut over to Acosta. So there was a significant build up over the course of the year, particularly when you include the 3%-plus at the end of the third quarter related to the separation. And that all obviously came back into line in the fourth quarter, which hit us. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. If I could quick follow-up, Tony, in terms of the fourth quarter or even second-half performance, would you say the margins were actually a bit better than we thought? Obviously some cost savings there, but were the grocery brands and the businesses where you have  the highest share and the highest margins, were those the ones that actually fared reasonably well versus the promotion and EDLP switches, versus, let's say the more commodity-oriented brands where maybe it requires a little bit faster moving versus competitors that are more aggressive? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - EVP & CFO    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So, a couple ways to break it down. Productivity gains are across the board. Right? So the margin improvement I think is across-the-board at Kraft, and I've told you, this is a long-term benefit that we think we're going to drive, and we're in the early innings of it. In terms of what brands did well versus what brands did poorly, we're making tough portfolio choices on margin, materiality and momentum. And we tend to be driving and putting on-air and advertising those brands that meet those three key hurdles. 
And so what we're doing is looking at our major franchises, where we can offer the breadth of the Kraft portfolio, be it  Capri Sun and Kool-Aid, Lunchables, or the Mac & Cheese dinners with Velveeta or Kraft singles with Velveeta singles with Cracker Barrel singles, those are the key franchises at Kraft, and those are the ones where we tend to compete and drive the majority of the success of this model. 
Where we saw the downturn was where retailers or competitors said hey, there may be a value offering that we have, that they don't. And it's really a big category, usually a key category for a family. And we typically feel, and we believe long-term the breadth of our portfolio will win, there's some short-term hits. I've used the example with you before, Lunchables. Last year on Lunchables we had first decline in many years because we saw a low-priced entry from another meat player. And they came in with $1 Lunchable offerings. 
This year Lunchables are up mid-to high single digits as we've proven to retailers that they saw category trade down and no volume growth. So we're back with better Lunchables offerings that span the offerings, and we've been able to push back that short-term issue. We are confident that can grow this portfolio consistently by filling the key gaps in value in the good-better-best hierarchy with a portfolio that we think has more breadth than anyone else's.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diane Geissler,  CLSA - Analyst    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for having this call today, and not dropping this on us at Cagney. Very much appreciate that. I just wanted to ask about the 2013 outlook versus your longer-term outlook. I know you said you expect to grow in-line with your overall market growth. But I'm just wondering, looking at your portfolio and understanding that maybe some of the brands weren't invested in, when you are part of the larger organization, shouldn't there be an expectation that as you pull further away from Mondelez, and you're able to invest your cash flow in your own businesses, that growth rate should be a little bit higher than overall market growth? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - EVP & CFO    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, we've indicated, Diane, for 2013, we do expect, as a result of our innovation pipeline and some momentum we have that it should be above about 1 point above -- we have about 1 point of pruning yet to do in 2013, and yet we expect to come in on, so you can say organically we are about 1 point better than the market. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diane Geissler,  CLSA - Analyst    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Is that -- is your long-term expectation in line with that, or do you think that it could accelerate as you head into 2014, and you have more and more innovation? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - EVP & CFO    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hopefully that pipeline continues to build. You'll see our lead innovation person at Cagey next week, and I'll let you gauge how the strengthening of that -- as time goes on, and we feel good about that, we see how markets develop, we'll update that, but as of right now I would still set the expectation that we will grow at or above the food and beverage market. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diane Geissler,  CLSA - Analyst    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Is the ongoing pruning, is that something we should think about in terms of every year you'll be doing? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - EVP & CFO    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How I separate it, Diane is that this is extraordinary pruning. This is things that, it is product lines and more than just SKU pruning that goes on in ordinary course, and always will go in ordinary course. This is extraordinary, where we have a full product lines that are just not profitable or not close to being able to achieve an appropriate level of margins and so forth that we're doing to clean up the portfolio. That should substantially be finished in 2013, and then it will go in the background.

Our next question comes from David Palmer of UBS. Please go ahead. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Palmer,  UBS - Analyst    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony, you told that story about Oscar Mayer versus Mac & Cheese, and that story is a reminder that these categories are a bigger deal to the new Kraft Foods than they might have been to the previous company. You mentioned the vertically integrated company made the push in lunch meats and maybe for that player lunch meat and processed meats represent a margin up growth, and for you Oscar Mayer, I'm not so sure that category represents that. 
My question is, how do you try to manage your margins holistically from here? I'm thinking you defended the Mac & Cheese, this is a high-margin category, certainly worth defending, but perhaps all categories of a certain size are worth defending in the new Kraft. And the lesson is that you have to be vigilant on -- and battle on all fronts, otherwise the results are too severe with a value-conscious consumer? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So I think you make some very good points. By the way, I think the breadth of the portfolio is a strength. In fact, it can handle the hits that one business may take through a volatile commodity year or tough competitor. The reality is though, you're right. $1 billion brand, we've got to exercise the playbook very well in those brands. 
And cold cut example is one where I'm laying out the regret that I didn't take my net productivity advantage that we created across the portfolio, and apply it in a defensive way to offer that value, without lowering price by the way, offer just the benefit of the playbook, which can be taking scale net productivity gains and lean Six Sigma, and offering bonus pack value, upsizing the kinds of things we do to ensure the consumer sees value for the price of different innovation levels. 
You're absolutely right, I've got to win in my key margin materiality momentum categories. But I also think the portfolio has the kind of strength where we can make the choices to ensure that we win across the board. It's a journey, David. And in this case I'm very proud of the progress in most retailers, but there's some key EDLP customers that will focus on going forward. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Palmer,  UBS - Analyst    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If I could just throw one more in on the coffee segment, it looks like competitors have preemptively -- they saw you coming. You saw some promotions in the fourth quarter from Green Mountain and we saw some from Smuckers a little bit later. It feels like the average cup price is quickly moving to $0.50 a cup on deal. How is that category, in your view -- is it quickly dissolving to a much more promotional category than you would have thought? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would say this. There's nothing like the tailwind that a growing category provides. Right? So on-demand and K-cups and that market, you know are only 12% to 14% penetrated in the US. We've got at least 20 points to go to catch up to Canada and Europe. And while you'll see pricing battles, there's nothing like growth to offer scale advantage and that's why we think the breadth of our portfolio is an advantage. And a corollary, when MiO had the challenge of private label, yes, the price of the average instant replenished water came down, but MiO is up 67% this year, in the face of private label. Growing categories, if we execute the playbook, I think we can win and the retailer can win, even if there's a natural price competition that comes.

Thilo Wrede,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony, I want to follow-up on the answer to you gave to the very first question, in hindsight do you regret not having defended cold cuts a little bit more? Does that mean philosophically in the future when any of your categories come under pressure, that you might take a more practiced stance in defending them? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We want to be a competitive consumer products company, and I want to win on my key brands. But I will tell you, I gave you the Lunchables example, where we chose to wait out and show the retailer that they were trading down in price in a category, and it worked. We didn't have the normal stellar Lunchables year a year ago. This year, those competitors, we've been able to prove that Lunchabkes offers the best value to the consumer and drives category growth and margin for the retailer and for us. So it's a category-by-category decision. But in general I want a very competitive company that drives great brands. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thilo Wrede,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [80]

Would your competitive spirit go as far as offering private label products, if that's what it takes to defend a good part of your portfolio? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have so many great opportunities in our brands that I just don't see that on the horizon as a strategy for Kraft.

Matthew Grainger,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just two quick clarifications, and this may be a redundant question, but it's Friday, so I'll ask it anyway. Since we look out to 2014, I understand you're going to be recognizing restructuring costs above what you would consider ongoing levels, but just on the $0.22 benefit on the post-retirement accounting should we be -- I think you said earlier in the call that this would not repeat, and I just want to clarify, should we be thinking about an element of this as a one-time benefit, or is that fully structural reduction in your ongoing?  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - VP of IR    [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, Matt, that actually does lift the base level of earnings. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All right. That's great. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - VP of IR    [90]

We adjusted our guidance for $0.22 that we outlined, that is a step up of the base, or a reduction of the ongoing expense. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew Grainger,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [91]

Okay. As we think to 2014 we don't need to take into account any significant change in that figure?

I was going to say the only thing that you'll see in 2014 from an EPS perspective is, as Tim outlined, a step down in restructuring costs from about $300 million that we expect in 2013 down to about around $125 million on a go-forward basis.

Matthew Grainger,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [93]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. One last question, just with respect to packaged meats and the decisions you've made on trade spending, just to clarify there, have you reinnstituted some of the programs that you had initially hoped to roll back? And should we think about that ongoing dynamic having any impact on your planned advertising or marketing spend into 2013? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [94]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think you're going to see us reinstate trade spending to address the cold cuts situation. It's purely a competitive entry in a value segment, that we actually have offerings, that we now can use the other pieces of playbook and our scale advantages to compete. We chose not to, just a prioritization decision on how you spend your money, but I think if you know that player that came in, yes, they came at the lowest rung on the price ladder, but in fact we have quite a nice good-better-best offerings that we can compete with equity innovation, and using our scale advantages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Thanks, everyone.

Thanks very much for joining us early this morning, and if anybody has any follow-up questions, the analysts can follow-up with myself and Doug Dumars and anybody in the media who has further questions, can follow-up with Basil Maglaris from our corporate communications department. Thanks again for everybody joining us, and we'll see you Tuesday at Cagey. Thank you.
