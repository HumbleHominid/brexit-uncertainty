Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Deutsche Post DHL conference call regarding DP DHL Q3 results 2013.  (Operator Instructions).  Let me now turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Martin Ziegenbalg.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, and good afternoon or good morning from wherever you're listening to our nine-month earnings call on Deutsche Post DHL, as announced, with our CEO, Frank Appel, right next to me, and also our CFO, Larry Rosen, who will take you through the presentation that I take it you have in front of you or on the web or even on our IR app.  And as usual, we will have sufficient time for any Q&A after that formal presentation.
And without any further comments, I'd like to hand over to Frank, please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon or good morning.  I'm happy to share with you some of our news on how we performed in the third quarter, and I will also comment a little bit about the strategic priorities going forward, with some highlights on certain topics, and then Larry will give you more details on the financials.
So let me start on page 3 of the presentation.  All key drivers of our development are still intact and have helped us to generate a solid third quarter, as well.  In particular, TDI and parcel growth again has shown solid growth.  We had another quarter where we were able to stabilize on our target, the EBIT number for mail.  We see as well what we have seen already in Q1 and Q2, and as promised, an acceleration of the margin in express.
And as you see, will see later from Larry, we had another good quarter on cash flow generation, and that's a consequence of tight cost management and focus on cash flow.  And that's the reason why we are confident that we will deliver what we have given you last time, the guidance of an EBIT of EUR2.75b to EUR3b.
If we turn to page 4, you can see first Q3 on the revenue side.  Actually, the underlying -- or not the underlying, the excluding currency changes number would be 3.5% up.  But of course, as you know, the euro has strengthened more or less against all leading currencies, and that's the reason why our revenue is down.
We were able to improve, despite the revenue decline and the headwind from currencies, our EBIT number by 7%.  And finally, and Larry will explain that later, we have been more or less in line with our net profit, as well.  Larry will give some indications why the net profit is a little bit less up than the EBIT later on.
For the first nine months, as well, currency impact on revenue, therefore the revenue number is flat.  EBIT is as much up as in the third quarter and net profit is significantly up, but we had some gains as well from a missing one-time effect as we had last year, with state aid and VAT.  So a solid quarter, in line with what we have demonstrated so far.
On page 5, you see the healthy trend in our parcel business.  As we always say, we are enabling the online business significantly and we have benefited from that for a while now.
Since Q1 2010, our growth was 9.3%, and you have seen that it hasn't slowed down.  We had another good quarter, with 8.7 percentage growth.  That's very much in line what we have seen earlier this year, so we are very happy about that because that's a key driver behind the revenue growth we experienced in mail.
On page 6, similar picture, slightly differently shown, on express.  Of course, in 2009 and early 2010, there was still a very weak economy, but we have seen already at that time a small growth.  That has accelerated significantly and was supported very much by our investment into the network and the service quality.
And since the beginning of this year, as we promised at the Capital Markets Day last year, we have seen a nice development of our margin improvement.  So express is exactly following what we have promised and has continued to gain market share in the TDI business.
You see as well the acceleration of the margins on page 7 for express, where we compare the different quarters from 2011 to 2013, and the third quarter this year was not an exception from the rule.  Again, 1.2 percentage points margin improvement, as predicted, not as much or almost as much as we had in Q2, but a very nice expansion of the margins.  And that is driven by really the volume growth we have experienced now for a while.
On page 9, if I come to the strategic priorities, nothing is new on that page.  We have shared that with you for a while now.  Of course, we have to continuously stabilize the EBIT in Deutsche Post, on the mail business, and have to continue our growth in parcels.  That is our focus, and I think we have delivered now for several quarters against both.
Express, as well, gaining market share and margin expansion, delivered as well.
Global forwarding freight, we have a major transformation with new organizational structures, processes and IT, which is, as I will explain later on, showing the first signs that this is working.  We had focused on profitable growth and profitable business.  And there is a very difficult environment, and as you will see later, we definitely have grown less or we shrinked faster than the market contracted, but we kept our number stable.  And the key focus now is really, going forward, to implement NFE, and on that basis to regain growth momentum.
Supply chain is continuing to win new business on a good scale.  We have not seen the impact, full impact, on the bottom line yet, but we are working on that through our industry expertise, and we are quite happy that we have seen significant growth on our top line in recent quarters.
Here we go to page 10, just for explanation what the Federal Network Agency has decided.  We communicated that already, the reduction of the so-called x-factor which we have to deduct from inflation rate, and the result of that inflation minus the x-factor gives us the opportunity for price increases, and that has been reduced from 0.6% to 0.2%.
That comes also from the Network Agency is seeing that productivity gains are getting more and more difficult, but it gives us on the other side more potential for price increases, and you see that potentially we can decide that we increase prices by 1.6 percentage points on a base of EUR3.3b.  We will make the final decision if we apply for a price increase very soon, but we have not taken the final decision.
On page 11, you see a summary of what we intend to do with the new forwarding environment, and there's nothing new on that.  The only thing which is new is on the bottom right.
We are now live in one country with the pilot, and the pilot is showing us that the system is working.  The response times are great, and the people are pretty excited about the upside of the system in comparison to the past.  So what we say here is we really get the expected improvements and process optimization, and that's very healthy.  So we are continuing with our process and we are very confident that we will roll out the system in 2014.
In addition, we have lower costs -- despite that they are increasing year over year, we have lower costs than originally planned, which is good as well.  That comes from very tight project management.
So I'm very happy about that.  And you remember that we at times said this will really change the rules of the game in the forwarding industry, and all what we have seen so far is confirming that again.  So all on base on that, on the development of Q3 and the success of the strategic initiatives.
We are again confirming today that we are confident that we can deliver in 2015 at minimum a billion in mail and that we will go for the EUR2.7b, EUR2.9b in the DHL divisions combined and that we will further improve our costs in the center.  So there is no change to that midterm guidance, and we disclosed it already more than a year ago to all of you.
So, with that, I would like to hand over to Larry for more detailed information on our financial figures for the Group.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, and good morning or good afternoon to everybody.  I'm pleased to continue our presentation now, and we'll focus on financial performance, followed by a review of our guidance for the full year.
Over to the next slide, we start with our profit and loss statement for Q3.  As Frank said, reported revenues were minus 2.5%, but that included fairly strong currency effects, as well as some effects from small divestitures.  Our organic growth for the quarter was 3.4%.
EBIT increased by 7%, with mail and DHL each increasing around 6% and corporate center costs flat.
Tax expense continues to reflect our expectation of an effective tax rate for the full year of 22%.  The increase compared to last year reflects the very low rate in Q3 of 2012, as we adjusted downwards our expectation for the full year 2012 in Q3 of last year and adjusted for the higher rate that we had booked during the first half of 2012.
Net profit and EPS were up around 6%, restrained somewhat by the higher tax expense.  But as Dr. Appel showed earlier, EPS growth year to date is close to 20%.
Now, on to page 15, we have a look at our cash flow performance.  We're actually very pleased with the Q3 operating cash flow generation, at close to the same level as last year on a like-for-like basis, in effect preserving and continuing the significantly better year-over-year performance we had achieved in the first half.
As you can see, reported cash flow was significantly higher than last year, since Q3 of 2012 was the quarter that we actually paid the VAT settlement.  So we booked it in the P&L mostly in Q2, but we actually paid it in Q3 of last year.  We're very confident to be able now to generate sufficient free cash flow to more than cover the dividend that we paid in May of this year.
And on to page 16, you see the quarterly trend compared to 2012 and 2011.  And as mentioned, Q3 was close to the level of the last two years on a clean basis and showed the expected seasonal increase compared to the first half of the year.  A year-over-year decline in working capital improvement in the global forwarding division in Q3 was the main reason cash flow didn't actually increase over last year's level.
Through the end of Q3, we continue to be far ahead of the last two years, around EUR700m excluding the VAT improvement, and over EUR1b improvement on a reported basis.
And on page 17, we turn for a moment to the balance sheet and our net debt position, and one can see that we improved in Q3 due to the strong cash flow performance.  And while we expect a significant pickup in capital expenditures in Q4, we also expect the usual seasonal increase in operating cash flow, leading overall to another significant improvement in the net debt position expected by the end of the year.
So, over to page 18, we take a look for a minute at our financial debt portfolio.  With the issuance of two bonds in early October, maturing in 2018 and 2023, and those that are looking at it in color see the yellow bars and those years, with that, we've essentially completed the refinancing towards our target finance structure.
These most recent bond issues pre-finance the January 2014 maturing bond, the EUR926m, so that no new financing or refinancing is anticipated to be needed for the foreseeable future.  We're very pleased that all financings have been done with coupons below 3%.
In addition, we recently completed the early renewal and extension of our standby, unutilized EUR2b liquidity facility on more favorable terms than before.
Now, on page 19, we have a look at division performance and start with the mail division.  Parcel volumes continue to grow at a high-single-digit rate, driven by the e-commerce trend.  Mail communication volumes grew by over 4%, supported by one additional working day compared to the Q3 last year and the shift of the Infobrief product from dialogue marketing to mail communication.  Q3 was also supported by a small positive effect from volumes associated with the German elections.
On the next page, you see that mail revenues increased due to the mentioned volume trends, as well as the price increase compared to last year.  EBIT increased by around 6% and benefited from the absence of the charge for the Neckermann insolvency that we had last year, around EUR10m.  The wage increase of 3.1% from the latest wage agreement took effect on August 1, offsetting some of the gains from the volume and revenue increases achieved during the quarter.
On page 21, you see that the express division continued to perform very well, with TDI growth again above market and a narrowing effect of mix changes on revenue growth.  Especially noteworthy were the strong growth rates achieved in all regions, led by Asia, Middle East, Africa.
And over to page 22, express revenue growth was significantly affected by currency trends, in particular much weaker Asian and other emerging market currencies compared to last year.  On an organic basis, express revenue increased by over 5%.
EBIT increased almost 14%, benefiting strongly from the leverage effects on our cost base associated with higher core volumes.  And as Dr. Appel already presented, the result was again a strong increase in our EBIT margin.
Operating cash flow also increased strongly due to the EBIT increase, good working capital management and the absence of some negatives we had last year, such as the VAT settlement.  If you remember, express bore about EUR30m of the VAT settlement that we paid in Q3 last year.
CapEx continues below expected levels, but this is more phasing than an actual reduction in investment plans.
On page 23, we look at global forwarding and freight.  We see that volume trends continue to reflect weak industry growth as a result of the overall still soft economy.  Q3 industry air freight growth is estimated at around 0% and ocean freight at plus 1% to 2%.  Our below industry growth reflects our regional and sector mix, as well as our continuing selective strategy to preserve gross profit and EBIT margins.
On the next page, we see that revenue declined for the division in Q3 around minus 2.5% on an organic basis, mainly due to the volume decline.  Despite the revenue trend, EBIT and EBIT margins were both up due to better gross profit conversion and our continuing selective strategy.  Cash flow decreased due to the exceptionally strong quarter last year, reflecting a rebound from the poor performance we had in working capital levels during the first half of 2012.
Now, on page 25, we see that supply chain continued to win an impressive number of new contracts, with EUR350m in Q3 and now over EUR1.1b for the year to date.  Our strong value proposition in both mature and emerging markets continues to drive this trend.  In Q3, notable new contracts were won in the life sciences and automotive sectors.
And on the next page, EBIT declined around 9% for supply chain in Q3, despite 6.6% organic revenue growth.  The primary drivers of the EBIT decline are the continuing soft conditions affecting existing contracts in Europe.  Cash flow performance for the division continued to be strong, mainly as a result of continued good working capital performance.
Now let's review, on page 28, our guidance for the full year.  And here we've made one change this quarter, reducing our expectation for CapEx spending for the full year from maximum EUR1.8b to EUR1.7b.  This is primarily a result of phasing rather than lowering our spending plans.  Otherwise, our guidance for the divisions and total Group remains unchanged.
The unusually wide implied range for Q4 reflects some uncertainty, neither necessarily positive or negative regarding the strength of the holiday season this year.  And we confirm our guidance for free cash flow; that is, it should be in excess of what's needed to cover the dividend this year and our net income performance for the full year, which we continue to expect to grow faster than our growth in operating income or EBIT.
And in summary, now on page 29, we look at our targets and priorities, which essentially remain unchanged.  The environment remains volatile, and we therefore focus intensively on cost and cash management.
We continue to expect strong growth in TDI and further margin improvement.  We actively drive the mail division shift towards the growing parcel market.  And we keep working on key projects such as NFE, Parcel 2012 and the continued optimization of our express network.  And finally, we confirm again our 2013 and midterm targets.
So thanks for listening, and now we would be happy to answer your questions.

Questions and Answers

(Operator Instructions).  Robert Joynson, Macquarie.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Joynson,  Macquarie - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, gentlemen.  Just a couple of quick questions from me.  First of all, in express, you mentioned that CapEx was below the expected levels, partly due to phasing.  Could you just provide some clarity on when you would expect express CapEx to start to increase again, and also what you estimate maintenance CapEx to be in that business?
And the second question is just on forwarding.  Both the gross profit per tonne and the gross profit per container were down quite significantly in Q3 on a quarter-on-quarter basis.  Could you maybe just provide some color on what drove that and whether we should expect unit profitability to remain at those relatively low levels?  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  So I think you can expect CapEx for the express division to already start increasing again in Q4.  Again, if you look at our year-to-date spend and what we're forecasting for the full year, you see that overall for the Company we have a big spending quarter planned, and express is certainly going to be part of that.
So, for forwarding, you're right about the GP per tonne and GP per container.  Overall, for the whole division, our GP margin has stayed relatively flat, and that is partly due to the selective strategy.  We're just being very disciplined about assuming potentially loss-making or very low-margin business, and we've so far given up a bit of volume.
It's one of the reasons that we're growing slower or having even worse performance than the industry as a whole, but so far we think that's been the right strategy.  We're seeing definite progress in our GP conversion to EBIT, and for now that's the strategy we're staying with.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Joynson,  Macquarie - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.  And just going back to the first question, is it possible to provide any idea of the maintenance CapEx which is required to keep the express business going in its current form?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think we would refrain from giving a concrete answer to that question.  On one hand, it's competitively sensitive.  On the other hand, it's in express especially hard to differentiate between maintenance and growth CapEx.  So if you replace an aircraft with a bigger, more fuel efficient aircraft, so that's partly maintenance investment and partly growth investment.  So I think that we won't give you a concrete answer to that question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Joynson,  Macquarie - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understood.  That's helpful nonetheless.  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen Furlong,  Davy Research - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, Larry, Frank.  I have a question, actually, just more on the macro.  You described the environment as volatile.  What do you think it would need on the GDP front to kick start world trade growth, which has been extremely anemic in the last couple of years?
And just the second thing, I noticed like with factor costs going up in the mail business, I was just wondering, would you think more in terms of CapEx and investment going forward over the medium period and looking more maybe at parcels, maybe internationally or indeed in the global mail business?  That would be great.  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  So I think macroeconomic growth has been below trend for way too long, for at least five years.  We would be very pleased to see it come back to historical trend level of around 4% real GDP growth.  We think that would certainly give us a good chance to increase the overall trade growth.
We'd be happy at this point to see it get back over 3%.  And hopefully we're going to see some of the promising signs really turn into better growth and come somewhere close to the 3% next year, but it's, as usual, hard to predict.
So, in mail, we are investing heavily in both productivity and capacity increases in the project Parcel 2012, and the parcel market is one that has good leverage when you can get volume growth.  So we hope that we're going to get some benefits in terms of productivity and efficiency and leverage on those investments.  That certainly is our plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stephen Furlong,  Davy Research - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Great.  Thank you.

Andy Chu, Deutsche Bank, London.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andy Chu,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.  Good afternoon, Frank.  Good afternoon, Larry.  Three questions, if I may, please.  Just starting with cash flow, please, and Larry, I think last year, when you stripped out the pension one-off, you delivered an underlying free cash flow in Q4 of EUR873m.  I was just wondering whether there was anything either in that number last year or anything that one can think of materially in Q4 this year that may mean that the EUR873m isn't the right starting point to think about year-on-year free cash flow generation.
Secondly, within supply chain, the only division where profitability has gone modestly backwards, you mentioned obviously some soft business conditions in Europe.  It's obviously a contractual business, so are there some contracts there that have gone south because of volumes, or could you maybe just elaborate as to the outlook, what's happened in the outlook for supply chain?
And then lastly, on the NFE program, it feels as though you've got that costed very soundly, and we have yet to really see any year-on-year or material year-on-year impact in NFE costs in 2013.  Is that likely to be the case for 2014, that we won't be able to spot the join year on year in material amounts of NFE costs?  Thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry, I'll take the middle one with supply chain and you take the cash flow and the NFE cost development.
So, Andy, on the supply chain, of course we have still some challenges in some domestic markets in Europe, which doesn't give us -- and the real reason why you see a decline is because there is always a time delay between the down-trading and how we can take measures to compensate for that.  It's more resilient in one or the other, this business.  The volatility is less strong than in other businesses.
And I think if you look into the quarter, we have seen already that the supply chain business is heading in the right direction, even if the quarter is still impacted by that.  So we have a certain time to elapse until you see the countermeasures the team is taking, and that's the reason why we have a slightly deterioration of the profits in Europe, and that has had impact on the overall profitability in Q3.  But the underlying trend in the quarter is heading in the right direction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  So let me comment on the cash flow question for Q4.  So, you see with our CapEx guidance for the year at EUR1.7b and our spending in the first three quarters at around EUR900m that we have quite a big quarter planned for CapEx spending.  It will be above the level of last year.
So that certainly will be a factor.  I think that's as concrete as I would want to be, remembering that our guidance for the full year is that we are going to generate enough free cash flow to be able to cover the dividend.
So, on NFE, I don't think we want to give a forecast for the 2014 costs yet.  We may do that in March, when we announce the full-year guidance for the year.  We saw in Q3 that costs picked up a little compared to the previous year.  We would expect that trend to continue in Q4, and we'll talk about 2014 at latest when we talk about our full-year guidance in March.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andy Chu,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right.  Thanks very much.

Operator    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johannes Braun, Commerzbank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johannes Braun,  Commerzbank - Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  Thank you for taking my question.  I have two.  Firstly, on the guidance, you already mentioned that the guidance range is pretty broad for the time of the year, and I appreciate that the visibility for the peak season at this point is somewhat limited for the Christmas season and so on.  But given the current trends you are seeing, what would be your base case here?  Is it the midpoint of the range, is it the upper end or is it the lower end?
And secondly, on currency effects, you quantified the currency effects on the top line.  Could you also do that for the EBIT line?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  So I think we are very conscious that the Q4 implied guidance range is quite wide, and we've left it intentionally so.  If we were able to narrow it, we certainly would at this point.  So I think we just want to leave our guidance where it is.
So, in terms of the currency effect on EBIT, certainly it did have an effect, and it was a headwind effect.  We would prefer not to quantify it.  It's a risk.  It is an element of volatility that we have every quarter and every year in our business, and it's something that we just have to manage.
And so, rather than using it as an excuse, we would prefer to just say it was a headwind, certainly in the quarter and actually for the full year thus far.  But it's something that we are managing and performing well despite that headwind.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johannes Braun,  Commerzbank - Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would you expect this to have a similar year-over-year impact in Q4?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is some reason to expect that it will have an effect in Q4, though perhaps not as acute as in Q3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Johannes Braun,  Commerzbank - Analyst    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right.  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neil Glynn,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, everybody.  If I could first ask a question with respect to express, TDI volume growth seemed to slow in the third quarter, both in Europe and the Americas.  I was interested in terms of understanding that dynamic.  Is that a function of weaker FX in emerging markets hurting exports, or is there more to it than that?
And then, secondly, just a broader question with respect to the 2015 targets.  The forwarding earnings, certainly with respect to the third quarter, have been broadly flat for three years now.  I'm conscious that NFE is obviously being implemented, and supply chain performance is disappointing.  To what extent do these developments increase the burden on express to continue to perform extremely strongly, to ensure you reach 2015 targets?  Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
May I comment on that?  And you can comment, or maybe you start with the first question, Larry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Yes.  So, in terms of volume growth, we wouldn't have a currency effect for that.  It can be a bit volatile from region to region, from quarter to quarter, but the overall growth of 8.4% was still quite satisfactory and we think was well above market growth.  So we were actually quite satisfied with the express growth during Q3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  On the two divisions, we are very confident that we will see significantly less expenses on forwarding due to NFE and (technical difficulty) lift the performance significantly.
And second, as I said, the pilot results of improvement are very encouraging from the pilot, so we expect beyond that costs will go away, also operational improvement already in 2015 and other years.  And therefore, we are very confident that DGF will contribute to the goals in 2015 significantly.
Yes, we have some challenges in supply chain, but I think the measures we have taken to improve will be more and more visible in the upcoming quarters, and therefore we expect as well a significant contribution, as well.  So they not only lie on the back of express to help us to achieve our goals for 2015.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neil Glynn,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Frank.  If I could just follow up with one question, just again on supply chain, is it possible to elaborate on the measures that you're taking in response to the weakness that we've seen in the third quarter?  Are there any key aspects to developments?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, it's worth putting Q3 in perspective, to note that it was our best quarter for the year.  We had quite good organic top line growth.
I think the key for supply chain is what we think of as continually enriching the contract mix over time.  Our great success at winning new, attractive business gives us every chance to do that, and we are confident that we are going to be able to improve the performance of the division over time substantially, as we see the effects of those new, more attractive contracts start to play out.
And frankly, the termination or the end of what may be unattractive contracts, as they come to their natural end, we simply won't renew them if they are not meeting our internal hurdles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  And let me add the challenge is somehow that the measures the division is taking by having a very systematic approach on (technical difficulty) mean new business with more attractive margin, ramping that up successfully, is overlaid by the challenge we have in some parts of the world from the economic environment.  And the supply chain business is more domestic business driven, and that has been more volatile than the (technical difficulty).
And therefore, you have overlapping factors and therefore you don't see that the new business is helping us because there is some down-trading from existing business, which is more coming from the economic development in some parts than really about -- from the fundamental problem with contracts.  And that is what we have seen in cycles all over the place, and if that is changing then we should see some tailwind from existing business.
And on top of that, we are pretty sure that we will have a record year of new business with healthy margins.  So, therefore, we should see from these activities we have been focusing on for a while a good development in 2014 and 2015.

Yes.  Good afternoon.  Three questions from my side, if I may.  Firstly, on minimum wage, if Germany now switches towards the minimum wage, would that lead to any cost increases for your suppliers somewhere?  And turning that around, do you think many of your competitors still employ low-cost labor and might thus save some cost increases on the back of that?
Secondly, on forwarding, apologies if I'm picking on that, but I think the volume performance is a bit disappointing, and especially when I've seen your competitors they have all accelerated volume growth in the third quarter.  And I guess my concern around that is that you may be implementing the most efficient cost platform in the market, but you may lose sight of the customer in that process.  And I just wanted to have a broader answer on whether that's a valid concern and whether you're doing anything particular to mitigate that.
And lastly, notorious question on E-Postbrief; number of subscribers and the revenues you generate with that product to date.  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me start with the last one, on the E-Postbrief.  We will not disclose the subscription rate, but we can say that we are very confident to deliver EUR100m revenue with that product by the end of the year, so that is as we said already earlier.
Minimum wage, if that comes, it will have very little to none impact on us, because we are in the area of parcel and letters.  We have significantly higher salaries already.  We are paying already -- if we have subcontractors, already at that level which is in current discussions or even beyond, so we don't see any impact.
Yes, it should have some impact on our competitors, and particularly in the parcel business.  But the question is, if you introduce minimum wage, who will control that people are not extending their working hours to compensate that, and have additional working hours for -- without getting any payment.
And therefore, the impact might be very little.  Or if there is a good control mechanism, it should be positive for us because the competitors definitely have to increase their salaries.  But I would not overestimate that impact.  Despite that, I think it's right to introduce for services at least a minimum wage.
On DGF, I think the challenge we have is that we are very much exposed with our large customers to technology and engineering manufacturing, and some of these guys are just down-trading massively at the moment.  We have not lost business.
The strategy which lies behind that and that's different from some of our competitors that have done that already before is that they are much more happy, much more focused on medium and small customers.  I think Roger has introduced that quite successfully, if I look into the detail, in the last 12 months.  But to compensate for a big engineering and manufacturing customer who is down-trading more than EUR100m, and we have such cases, you need a lot of new mid-sized customers to compensate.
So the benefits of that strategy will come only over time and are not visible short term because, as I said, we have down-trading customers on a big scale by having less volume and down-trading from air to ocean.  And being the largest air freight and the second largest sea freight, we are more impacted than others.  But we haven't lost share of wallet; it's really down-trading.
And therefore, I am very confident that we have not lost customer focus, that we have redirected customer focus to the mid and smaller customers, and some of our competitors have been more focused.  On the other side, we have to say as well, some of our competitors gained volume but didn't gain anything on the bottom line.  So of course there is a lot of business you can buy, but it doesn't come with any profits, and we have refused to get this business and we don't need that.
And that's the third element somehow why our volumes are developing less than the market.  So that's, I think, the explanation behind that.  I think it's not that we lost focus on customers because we are distracted by NFE.

Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [36]

Yes.  Good afternoon.  Just a number of quick questions, please.  First of all, on the forwarding business and with respect to express as well, historically it's been mentioned that obviously, as the TDI side grows, you try and fill your express aircraft and committed capacity with more of the higher-margin TDI business and less of the freight forwarding business.  How much, if anything, has that been a factor between -- behind the selectivity, particularly in the air side, over Q3?  And if it has been, how much more has that got to play out?
Then, secondly, sticking with forwarding, obviously the GP fell but the SG&A costs fell as well, actually disproportionately more, and hence the EBIT was up.  Does that have any meaningful impact from the NFE pilot in New Zealand in it, or is that still to come?  And if so, how sustainable are the extra savings in that Q3 SG&A cost?
And very finally, on the express business, volume is up 8% but FTE is up only 0.4%.  Again, how much more can you push the envelope on utilization in that business before you need to start adding cost?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So let me start.  Larry, you can comment on DGF.  Let me start with the express freight.
Yes, it has been, and that was predicted as well, that we are filling currently the extended network of express with the core product and replacing air freight, and that has had a significant impact on the numbers.  We are very cautious in communicating how long that impact can last, because that would give our competitors a good indication how well we are positioned globally with still capacity for core product before we have to expand the network, and therefore I would refuse to comment on that.  But definitely that will not go forever, but it's not over either.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  So let me address your question on DGF and express, to make sure that I've understood it.  So, the fact that our express business is growing and we have a bigger freight load with core product on the express planes, is that affecting our DGF business or are we losing business because of that?  I think the answer is no.
Indeed, DGF is one of the bigger express customers for what we call ACS or freight business or non-core loads to fill up the plane.  But of course DGF has many different choices in addition to express, and if they've got an attractive piece of business they are going to be able to move it.  So I would say overall it doesn't make a big difference that our express planes are a bit higher utilized with the core business.
So, in terms of our continued improved gross profit conversion to EBIT, I would say that it's not NFE related.  It is really overhead cost management that is enabling us to get a bit better conversion rate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC - Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  So, just to be clear, the almost 2 percentage points lift you got in the third quarter, that's something that could sustain into the fourth quarter and beyond before NFE would build on that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I would say generally it is our goal to significantly improve EBIT conversion.  If you look at the industry leaders, you see that they have much better conversion rates than we do.
Certainly, NFE will be a significant contributor to allow us to streamline our processes further and to take out overhead costs, but it's something that we work on even in addition to NFE.  And of course, the NFE costs, while we incur them this year and next year, temporarily defer the improvement that we will see in EBIT conversion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Joel Spungin,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi there, guys.  Just two quick ones, actually, from me.  First of all, I just wanted to come back on something I think Neil mentioned earlier about volume, TDI volume growth in the third quarter in Europe slowing.  I was just looking through the numbers and, despite that, it looks like actually the actual organic revenue growth in the European business was actually pretty good.  So I was wondering if you could just help square the circle in terms of what's going on there in the European division of express.
And following on from that, it does look like you're obviously seeing decent growth out of the European business.  What's behind that?  Is it a matter of market share gains, or is there anything else going on there that gives you a bit more confidence in terms of the market overall?  So that's my first question.
And the second one was just a fairly straightforward one on central costs, which are still hovering around, obviously, the EUR400m mark for the full year.  Obviously, you've guided to reduce them by EUR50m by 2015.  Can you just remind me how you're going to go about doing that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  So let me start with the TDI question.  I think we probably shouldn't read too much into changes on a single-quarter basis.  Overall, for TDI, we are definitely growing faster than what we estimate the market growth to be, so we are gaining share.  The improvements in revenue growth in relation to volume growth are reflecting somewhat an easing of the mix effects that we've seen over the last quarters.
And so, overall, I think we are seeing a lot of different areas of improvement in TDI, and we think we grew also in Europe substantially faster than the overall European market growth rate.
So, in terms of central cost reduction, we still do expect to reach EUR350m by 2015.  There are a number of different factors that are coming into that.  A lot of it is just strict cost management.  Some of it is the end of some projects that we've run on a central basis.  And again, we confirm the overall goal of EUR350m.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joel Spungin,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Thank you very much.

Penny Butcher,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.  Good afternoon, everyone.  Two questions from my side.  One is perhaps a slight follow-on to the questions around growth and market share.  I think there was a comment in the press conference this morning that suggested that beyond the European markets that you feel that you have also gained share versus FedEx and UPS.  Could you comment on perhaps what geographies that may have been the case over the Q3, as they don't really break down their international volumes by geography?
The second question is in relation to the mail business.  Am I correct in understanding that there will be an upcoming renegotiation with the civil servants primarily in 2015, I think which is the expiry of the previous headcount deal that you have initiated with them?  Could you talk a bit about when you may start the process of that renegotiation and perhaps what you might look for in terms of updates to that deal?  Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  And you are right, Penny; the FedEx and UPS don't disclose their regional numbers.  It's probably a combination of anecdotal evidence.  That means that we are knowing that we got incumbent business from the others, and the interesting experience that we have a relatively balanced growth rate around the world in all regions.  And since our overall TDI growth is significantly above market, we are assuming that we are gaining market share everywhere.
And that's not surprising, because it's actually an end-to-end service, and customers want to have on both legs their service quality, and we are clearly optimistic that we have achieved that now.  And as you might know, we have inaugurated the extension of the Cincinnati hub this year, and that is supported by strong growth we have even out and inbound the US.
So you're right; we don't know that in detail until we really make a market research, but the anecdotal evidence Ken and I get and Larry get from our travel around the world from countries is pretty suggesting that we have gained market share everywhere.
The negotiations with that contract, that will not start before 2015, I guess, so it's still some way out.  And I would refrain from commenting already what our goals would be before we have not -- because I don't want to have that in the world already, what we intend and what we should do, before we even have started the discussions.  So please accept that I am hesitating in commenting already what our intention for these negotiations will be.

Robin Byde, Cantor Fitzgerald.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robin Byde,  Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  Hi, guys.  Actually, just one from me.  On stamp prices, I think you were saying that you have not yet decided whether you're going to apply the 1.6% increase.  So could you just say what will drive your decision on that, and when do you have to announce to complete all the various processes?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  So that's an interesting question.  We will definitely have another round of discussions soon, and it's of course driven by what do we expect on one hand from the market reaction, and we are still investigating that.  The second is we are still waiting for the final step of the new regime to be approved as well, and that should happen soon.
So these are the key drivers we are looking at, is it really right to do that now, what might be the response from customers, and we are currently assessing that.  And the assessment should be finished soon, and then we can make up our mind as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robin Byde,  Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  And just a quick follow-up, if you don't mind.  You say on the slide that any stamp increase will partially offset cost inflation.  Can you give us any guidance to what degree a price increase would offset extra cost?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  Roughly spoken, any percentage point increase in wages delivers roughly EUR50m additional cost, and if you see the base for the price increase would be 3.3 times 1.6, will be roughly EUR50m as well.  So 1 percentage point of the salary increase will be offset.  We have agreed that we will have next year an additional 2 -- slightly more, but I can't remember the next number, 2 percentage points, 2.1%, I think.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On average.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So that only will offset a part of that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robin Byde,  Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roughly half?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, if --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robin Byde,  Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If this price increase sticks; if we do a price increase and if it sticks 100%, because the good news for this year is the elasticity of demand has been relatively modest.  But you never know, there is competition in the market, and that's what we are assessing, as I said, at the moment.
But in principle, if we don't do any price increase for next year, we have a carryover, we can then push that to the year after.  So it will be not lost, just delayed, and it's a little bit an assessment now is it right already or should we wait for another year before we increase prices.  But technically spoken, it would offset half of the negotiated salary increase.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robin Byde,  Cantor Fitzgerald - Analyst    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Frank.  Very clear.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Robin.  And operator, do we have any more questions out there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, there are no further questions left.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  Well, that's a pretty swift round of Q&A.  So, after a foggy start into the morning, at least here in Frankfurt, the weather was foggy, it's sunny now, so that gives us now plenty of time to get on our flights and to reach out and see not all but many of you over the next days and weeks.  And yes, so thank you for participating and I want to hand over to our CEO, Frank Appel, for some closing remarks, please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frank Appel,  Deutsche Post AG - CEO    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  So thank you for listening to us this afternoon and thank you for the questions.
I think we have delivered a solid quarter again and I think, as you know us, in the meantime we are telling you where we see challenges and we called it a solid quarter because it was a solid quarter.  And we still have a way to go to deliver the guidance for this year, despite that we are confident that we will make it.  We are also confident that we will continue in our direction given you already last year with regard to 2015.
The economy currently is not helping in particular, so we are mainly dependent on all our own activities, but they have been quite successful already this year and we are confident that we can continue going forward.
So, again, thank you very much for joining us this afternoon, and talk to you soon.  Bye for now.
