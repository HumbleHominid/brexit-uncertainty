Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Good morning and thank you for coming. I'm going to hand over to Laurie in a moment but before I do that there are a few things I want to say.
The past year hasn't been without some significant challenges. Some relate to longstanding issues which we've had to address in order to set a new base from which we can grow. Some relate to factors that are outside of our control, the impact of regulatory changes in Korea being the one that I'd highlight specifically. Severe conditions consumers face in the eurozone haven't helped either.
But set against this is the progress we've made in the UK. Our plan to make a significant investment back into customers is on track. It's started to make a real difference. We made great progress against our six-point plan, we improved our performance in absolute and in relative terms and we're sustaining the margin at the new base that we set, 5.2%.
We also announced our strategic review of Fresh & Easy back in December because we'd established it wasn't going to deliver acceptable returns for shareholders in an appropriate timeframe. It could one day get to profit. It's just going to take too long. That review is now very well advanced and that's led to today's confirmation that it will conclude, that review, with an exit from the United States. We've taken the associated write-down of the carrying value of the business as a result.
I mentioned the external factors in Korea and Europe. Those combined consequences are a painful drag on performance I think particularly when it's been such a year of substantial change for the Group. But I need to be clear about this, it would be wrong for me to say they are fully behind us but I'm confident we're through the worst. We can't be immune from external factors of this magnitude, but what we do is we face into them, we adapt our approach and we ensure our business is as well-placed as possible, as it can be, to cope with any new ones that come our way.
As ever we're at our best when we focus on customers relentlessly and I tell you now this focus is absolutely driving what the Company does. It's about ensuring we respond to the changing needs of customers. I've been in Tesco nearly 40 years. There's never been a period of such profound and rapid change as we're seeing. The digital age is transforming not just the way people shop but the way that they live their lives.
The opportunities are tremendously exciting to make the lives of our customers easier, to enable them to shop in whatever way suits them best, to offer them new products, to offer them new services. But delivering on those opportunities requires a different kind of business, a different relationship with customers and requires for us a new set of capabilities. Now when we met here a year ago I signaled the end of the space race and a change in focus towards more multi-channel and smaller format. I'm not sure everyone in the industry agreed with me and maybe they still don't, but a year on I'm more certain than ever that this is the right thing to do.
I believe that we are extremely well-placed, probably better than any other to prosper in the new multi-channel world. Always been pioneers, always been innovators and, uniquely amongst our peers, we have a grocery home shopping business that's profitable. Thanks to Clubcard and dunnhumby we've got unique insights into how behaviors are changing, and our new conversation with customers is about listening to what they want, to how they're living their lives and building the business accordingly.
Stores are a very vital part of the multi-channel vision. We've got a superb portfolio of well-located stores in all of our markets, but many are in need of refreshing and of adaptation. By using the space more effectively particularly in our larger stores, I believe that even the largest of them have a great future. But at the same time the end of the space race means that some of the major developments that we conceived in the mid-2000s are no long appropriate for the Tesco of the future. The truth is we can deploy capital better elsewhere.
That's what has prompted the most in-depth review of property that I've known in my time at Tesco and the associated write-down you'll have seen our statement this morning. Laurie will come back to this subject in more detail shortly.
But it's not just about dealing with the investments we've already made. And again I feel the need to be very clear. The end of the space race underpins our capital discipline. Everything we are doing reflects my determination to deliver value for shareholders and set a more appropriate balance between investing for the future and delivering sustainable returns to our shareholders.
We are managing the business in order to generate positive free cash flow. We're going to allocate capital within a range of 4% down to 3.5% of sales, and we're going to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating. For our investors that means they can expect mid-single-digit trading profit growth, ROCE within a range of 12% to 15%, and we're going to resume dividend growth broadly in line with underlying earnings with a target cover of more than two times. These outcomes will be achieved through disciplined investment focused on those existing markets where we see the best opportunity for significant growth and significant returns.
Before I hand over to Laurie, we know there's a lot we need to do as we transform Tesco and we know where we've needed to we've taken very decisive action so we can focus our energies on those markets where we believe we can be a leader in the multi-channel world. I'll talk more about the strategy a little bit later and about our approach to growth and returns, but first Laurie is going to review the past year. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you Phil. It's been a year in which we've taken decisive action to focus our efforts on those markets where we can have leadership position. That's why we exited Japan, launched our strategic review of the US while at the same time taking a more measured approach to our growth in China. We also set an appropriate pace of migration for the Bank, keeping it focused on the needs of our most loyal customers. But most importantly we've begun the essential process of getting the UK business back on track making sure we protect and build on one of the most important leadership positions we have.
As you've seen, there are a number of one-off items included in the results we've announced this morning mainly as a consequence of the strategy decisions we've taken. I'll take a few moments to talk through the impact of these on the headline numbers before moving on to a more detailed explanation of our performance.
The most straightforward point to note is the treatment is Fresh & Easy as discontinued so that's not in our headline numbers now. The performance of our continuing operations is best described by a 13% reduction in trading profit which, as you know, reflects the investment in the UK, the impact of regulatory changes in Korea and a disappointing result in Europe, all of which I'll return to shortly.
The decline in underlying profit before tax is 14.5%, a slightly greater decline than that in trading profit, driven mainly by reduced JV income and increased net interest costs. There are three main one-off deductions. The GBP804m write-down of our UK property pipeline, a EUR425m goodwill impairment relating the Czech Republic, Poland and Turkey, and an increase of GBP115m in the Bank's provision for PPI. These one-off charges are additional drivers behind the 51.5% decline in our reported statutory profit before tax.
So now I'll go through our performance before these one-off items. Group sales for the year were GBP72.4b, a 3.1% increase at constant exchange rates excluding petrol. Group trading profit fell by 13% to GBP3.5b with the UK down 8.3% to GBP2.3b and International down 21.8% to GBP1b, and the Bank contributed GBP191m of trading profit. Our underlying profit before tax was down 14.5% also to GBP3.5b, with underlying diluted earnings per share declining by 14%. The Board has approved a maintained final dividend at 10.13p, demonstrating its confidence in the Group's ability to return to profit growth.
Net debt reduced by GBP0.2b year on year despite the trading profit impact and increased working capital, mainly due to the significant reduced capital expenditure and a small increase in property proceeds. The working capital increase was largely as a result of regulatory changes in a number of our markets and the shortening of order lead times for general merchandise, which reduced our creditor days. On return on capital employed, on a continuing operations and pre one-off basis it's 12.7%, and this is 200 basis points decline on returns calculated on a similar basis last year, mainly reflecting the profit performance.
In the UK it's a year since we unveiled our six-part plan to get the UK business back on top form. The UK is absolutely fundamental to the success of the Group which is why this is our number one priority of the year and, I'm pleased to say, the plan is very much on track. We've made the investments as planned and I'm pleased to report that it has led to a clear improvement in our performance and total sales rose by 2.6% excluding petrol and like-for-like performance has improved during the course of the year with particularly encouraging results at Christmas.
As you know, the comparative base was much tougher for the last quarter of the year following the unprecedented amount of couponing after our poor Christmas performance in 2011. But despite the comps I'm pleased to say that we've made a reasonable start to the new financial year. When we laid out our plan last year I described the impact of the investment in terms of rebasing of our trading margin to 5.2% and the progress we've made in the UK has been achieved whilst delivering a margin absolutely in line with these expectations.
I know that many of you are familiar with some of the changes we have made under the six-part plan in the UK. The stores are already in much better shape and you just have to visit any one of them to see plenty of evidence of the improvements we have made. You'll also have seen our update in this morning's release, so in the interests of time I'm not planning to run through this in detail.
As ever, the most important judge of progress is the customer and you may remember we introduced a new way of measuring customer perceptions back in July, our Customer Viewpoint. This measures real customer feedback in every one of our stores on a regular and frequent basis across 12 aspects of the shopping trip. I'm pleased to say that every one of these aspects has improved throughout the second half of the year and this underpins our confidence that the underlying improvement we've seen in our trading performance is driven by these changes that we have made for customers.
Whilst there are a number of drivers that could enable us to improve overall UK margins we believe the new base of 5.2% is appropriate for the foreseeable future and any outperformance here will be reinvested in driving additional improvements for our customer offer.
Moving outside the UK, our Asia performance was in line with expectations and was dominated by the Korean regulatory changes concerning trading hours. These changes held back our headline number as we expected and have flagged during the year, and the impact on trading profit was broadly in line with our GBP100m guidance with a ban on 24-hour trading and significant levels of Sunday store closures throughout the second half. This was compounded by considerable uncertainty for customers about exactly which stores would be closed and when.
Following the passing of the legislation in January the situation seems more certain with more consistent store closures expected on alternate Sundays. As such we expect the full year effect of the regulations combined with the extension of 24-hour trading restrictions to between midnight and 10am to lead to an incremental impact of around GBP40m in 2013/'14.
In Thailand like-for-like sales grew by 3.1% and we continued to gain market share. We benefited from a strong opening program including almost 300 Express stores and we launched our first dotcom grocery operation in Bangkok in February.
Completing my review of Asia, as we described last year, we've adopted a more cautious stance in China. We still see an excess amount of new space being opened in the market ahead of customer demand. We've moderated our pace of development accordingly, opening just 12 new stores this year and closing five underperforming stores. This is all part of our increased focus on our three strongest regions. We're working hard on the customer offer on China, introducing more localized store campaigns and a new communications strategy on prices and promotions. It's early days but these changes have received a positive initial response from customers.
Whilst our markets in Europe remain fundamentally attractive our performance this year has been disappointing. Clearly we've faced significant headwinds throughout the year as the macroeconomic uncertainties have continued to impact our business. You can see from this chart that every market has been seriously affected with very real consequences for our customers. The severity of the impact can be seen in the fact that the combined economies of the markets are over 12% smaller than they were in 2008 and this has had a particularly marked impact on general merchandise businesses across the region, holding back our overall like-for-like sales performance.
Our performance in Hungary and Slovakia, where we enjoy two of the strongest positions, has proved more resilient to the economic headwinds. It's also worth noting that while our profits in Hungary continue to be held back by the crisis tax this year, this ended last month and should result in around GBP30m of improvement year-on-year. In both markets we've seen particularly good growth in own-label sales with increasing participation driving improvements in our like-for-like sales.
In some markets, such as the Czech Republic and Poland, we've seen increased competitor activity, with those retailers focused on discount proximity formats fairing much better than those like us with a greater proportion of larger stores. Our own smaller format stores have performed better than the business as a whole and our dotcom operation, now in 13 cities in these markets alone, have grown strongly since launch.
In Turkey we faced a particularly intense competition in a year in which we've retrenched in our strategy of pursuing large stores expansion to the east of our existing business. Like many other businesses in the country we've faced intense cost-price inflation and the impact of this has been exacerbated by a number of one-off historic issues. The resulting losses have contributed to our shortfall versus expectations on Europe's performance.
On goodwill, all of our businesses undertake a value-in-use test each year to justify the carrying value of goodwill. Those businesses acquired in Europe in the '90s and the early 2000s face a more difficult market today and different growth prospects as a result. This has led to the write-down of the value of acquired goodwill for HIT in Poland, Carrefour in the Czech Republic and Kipa in Turkey.
Our priority in all of these markets is to get the business focused on driving underlying performance and it's for this reason that we'll only open 400,000 square feet in the year ahead, a point I'll come back to shortly. We do still have a significant opportunity to realize substantial cost savings and increase our differentiation by applying our Group skill and scale in the region, and with new management in place we'll also be redoubling our efforts in this area.
In December we announced a strategic review of Fresh & Easy as it had become clear that the business wouldn't deliver an acceptable shareholder return in an appropriate timeframe. The review is now well advanced including interest from a number of parties seeking to acquire Fresh & Easy as a trading business. As such the Board has confirmed that the outcome of the review will be an exit from the United States, resulting in our announcement today that we're treating the business as a discontinued operation.
Therefore we've booked a loss after tax for discontinued operations of GBP1.2b including the impairment of fixed assets, onerous lease and restructuring provisions, and the current year trading loss of GBP169m or GBP200m including property costs. Clearly the process is still underway and we'll provide you further update when appropriate.
Turning now to the Bank, we're pleased to have completed the final stages of migration early in the financial year and to be able to get back to focusing on marketing our existing products. Our program of new products resumed in August with mortgages and more recently with our ISA range. We made progress through the year in banking products with good growth in customer accounts and balances. Our insurance business has been somewhat held back by a very challenging market with strong downward pressure on price, specifically in motor insurance. Throughout this year we've focused in ensuring we offer the best products and prices to our most loyal customers.
In recent years the Bank's profit has been impacted by a couple of non-trading factors. The first, fair value releases and the second, run-off of our legacy insurance agreement with Direct Line. And before these, as we see here, the profits have grown well and are up 13%, with a particularly pleasing performance in customer lending. In line with the rest of the industry, in recent months we've been proactively consulting with our customers on PPI and in light of this contact it has become necessary to increase our provision for compensation by GBP85m in the second half in addition to the GBP30m provision in the first half, and this takes us to the GBP115m one-off charge you see in the accounts.
Now on to property and the write-down we've announced this morning. Our property portfolio remains one of our greatest strengths and forms a fundamental part of our multi-channel offer. Over the last 15 years, by acquiring, developing and trading high quality stores we've grown the value of our UK property to GBP20b and that's a premium to net book value of nearly 50%. We've also released GBP9b of proceeds over the last seven years and more than GBP2b of profit. We've used these proceeds to pay increased dividends and fund investment in higher growth opportunities overseas.
Over these years, because of complex planning approvals and long lead times we've needed to build up a substantial investment in land to deliver a steady stream of new space. But rather than building over 2.5m square feet a year, our new space growth will now be closer to 1m square feet, more focused on convenience for the future.
In the context of our new approach we've carried out a detailed review of our pipeline assessing each site's potential to deliver good long term returns. The consequence of this review is the write-down and impairment of a number of schemes including a significant number of aborted schemes, leading to the GBP804m we've announced in the release this morning. Much of this write-down is concentrated in a small number of large schemes and particularly mixed use schemes.
This fundamental change in our approach to new space also has had implications for the sale and leaseback program. Historically significant unrealized property profits have built up due to the pace of our expansion. Two years ago we announced a planned reduction in the level of profits realized in order to ensure a match to the level of profit created in the new store development. As a result of our changed approach to new space we will accelerate the reduction of the sale and leaseback deals such that they're unlikely to make a material contribution after the next few years.
So in summary, the UK firmly on track. Good growth in Asia dominated by the impact of regulatory changes in Korea. European performance held back by severe economic challenges. Bank growing at an appropriate pace following completion of the migration. One-off charges as a consequence of our strategic decisions we've taken. It's been a year of decisive action enabling us to tackle some of the longstanding issues. As a result we're well-positioned for the future.
I'll now hand you back to Phil who will update you on how our strategy is changing for the multi-channel world.

Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thanks Laurie. I'm now going to tell you how we intend to take the business on from here and how we ensure it prospers in the new era of retailing I described earlier, and in doing so how we deliver a sustainable balance of growth, of returns and of cash.
First, we needed a new conservation with customers, an open and transparent one. Whether we're talking about the launch of Price Promise or helping them understand how four of our products could be contaminated by equine DNA, we wanted to them to know that Tesco is on their side, that we listen to them and we build the business around them. We're already seeing real signs that those changes have made a big difference. For example, our interactions with our suppliers, they're more constructive, they're more direct. We're cutting out the middle man and we're working directly with farmers and growers. It will mean a more secure supply chain and it helps us work towards the new commitments that you may have heard I gave to farmers at the NFU Conference a few weeks ago.
We've also done an enormous amount to empower our colleagues to deliver the service that our customers are looking for and the chart that Laurie showed with that improvement in measures is good. I see it first-hand when I go to stores. I see a twinkle in the eye of our colleagues. I see them looking up now not looking down trying to avoid us. [40%] reduction in service-related complaints in January, [40%] reduction.
So we've changed the way we think through the organization and the way we act, but what does that mean for the shape of the business and how we grow in future? I said in my opening remarks we're in a period of profound change in the way people shop and the way that they live and if you look at the steps we've taken in the UK business over the past year we're demonstrating that doing the right thing for customers, by making what matters better, can win back their loyalty. It's about putting customers in control and that's where multi-channel comes in. It's about enabling the shopper to interact with Tesco in whatever way suits them best, using the power of multi-channel to offer exciting new products and services, and make life that little bit more enjoyable.
Ultimately it all comes down to the customer and it's the customer that has guided my three-pronged plan for sustainable growth and returns. Investing to make the UK business as good as it possible can be, really asserting our position as a multi-channel leader and, thirdly, pursuing disciplined growth internationally in those markets where we can make a difference and play a leading role. Now I'm going to take each of these in turn.
Firstly, continuing to strengthen the UK. I'm pleased we've made good progress but there's still a massive opportunity and I'm very excited by our plans for that progress to continue. Laurie has already updated you on the progress of Building a Better Tesco and over the past year we've made significant progress, but there's much more to come in the year ahead.
In the past month we've rolled out Price Promise nationwide following a successful trial in Northern Ireland. The vast majority of our customers are finding that it confirms that for them Tesco is already the cheapest for their basket of goods. But for those who could have saved money elsewhere they've received a coupon for the difference. It allows them to leave price at the door, removes the need to shop around and it further builds trust in Tesco.
As part of our work on quality and range, as well as completing the remainder of our core Tesco own-label range, we plan to relaunch Tesco Finest, already one of the UK's biggest food brands, later this year. We're going to continue to refresh more stores with an emphasis on Express, on Superstores following the successful trial we did last year in three stores and in Metro, and you'll have seen some of those changes in stores like Regent Street, Tooley Street and St. John's Wood. We're creating a more tailored offer, a more attractive environment and it really does make a difference in these shops.
The strength of the UK is going to be enhanced by the Bank as we see it becoming a more important part of the differentiation of our offer with products being tailored to Clubcard customers. We're the only retailer with a full bank. We don't white label anything. Benny Higgins who is here today is the CEO of Tesco Bank, runs the Bank for Tesco customers and for Tesco shareholders and doesn't worry about anything other than that. The profitability, he knows, is very important, but we see the biggest benefit being the development customer loyalty and this graph shows that customers with Tesco Bank products also tend to be extremely loyal Tesco shoppers and as we launch our current accounts in early 2014 that will help develop the loyalty even further.
The second key point of our plan to drive sustainable growth is multi-channel leadership. I'm really determined that Tesco will be the most accessible retailer across all formats and all channels and it's going to be critical to our future success. I've already set out that tomorrow's Tesco is being built around customers' behaviors and expectations, it means innovating for customers and offering them what they want, where they want it and how they want it.
It's not some idle ambition either. Other retailers may talk about multi-channel leadership, but we have already demonstrated that we innovate online and do so profitability with our online grocery offer and we've got the capability and the ambition to become the multi-channel retailer of choice in every market in which we operate. We're already online in eight of our international markets using the platforms we've developed and deployed so successful in the UK to launch quickly and productively.
Sometimes it takes a fresh pair of eyes to get the whole thing in perspective and Robin Terrell who recently joined us our Director of Multi-channel and is sat at the front was at an Exec a few weeks ago and he said -- you're really hiding your light under a bit of a bushel you know; what other business will have launched grocery online shopping in six countries in six months? I don't really tend to stand back too often and think about it but he's absolutely right, we've got the capabilities, we've got the skills, we've got everything and now we are really pushing on very hard.
We talk about grocery online as a uniquely profitable business and I know some of our competitors find that hard to understand. It does receive a natural subsidy from the stores business. Dotcom pays its share of property costs, but of course it benefits from leveraging the stores that it operates in.
And we do have to pay our people to pick our customer's shopping for them, but the model is highly efficient. It's not one person picking a full order, it's a team of colleagues each picking up to six customer's orders at once, each picking in one part of the store using very sophisticated software, we've spent more than a decade developing and refining. Picking is even more efficient in our dotcom centers which help to offset a higher property component. And I know many of you saw this in Enfield where you joined us in November. We've subsequently opened another in Crawley and we've got another one coming at the end of the year.
Our online business across the Group broke through the GBP3bn sales mark in the last year and we're continuing to grow well in every market. But, again, our existing stores are very much at the heart of the multi-channel plan. We need to refresh we need to refresh, we need to remodel and in some cases repurpose our existing space to ensure that our stores are the most relevant, the most compelling destinations for customers to visit.
Food is at the heart of our business and food first is the mantra we apply. Our thinking on ranging even for the larger stores starts with the idea food first. Not just on fresh food and groceries but ensuring we build our general merchandise offer around the categories which are most likely and closely related to the weekly food shop for our customers.
It does of course mean starting by being the best food retailer in town. Around this strong food offer we focus on our strengths in household and health and beauty. We then layer on strong ranges of those products which sit best alongside the family shop, homeware, stationery, toys, games, party, products that in many ways are consumable and form a key part of household spend where great value will be rewarded with improved loyalty.
I think clothing is one of the best examples of this and one where we've made the most progress so far. It continues to be a strong performer for us, much better ranges, improved quality and in some of our most recent new models like this one in Cambridge, a much stronger store environment all being rewarded with better trading results. And Jill Easterbrook who was the architect of this change two years ago is now a member of the Executive and it's in no small part to her efforts that we've got where we have with F&F. I'm delighted with this performance, GBP1b of sales, 9% like-for-like, not bad.
In some of our larger stores, and as a reminder in the UK we've only 50 stores that are over 80,000 square feet, even having strengthened these core general merchandise categories we can be left with excess space that provides the opportunity to create even more compelling destinations.
This is one area where our investments in Harris and Hoole, in Euphorium and in Giraffe come into their own. You can see a couple of images here of Harris and Hoole. A standalone top left on a high street in Southgate where I go and have my breakfast on a Sunday morning, and very good it is too. And on the right the first in a Tesco store at Tooley Street doing very well indeed. Then bottom left hand corner you can see Euphorium in Kensington. It's now in about five stores. And bottom right you can see Giraffe we recently purchased, will appear in Watford Extra in the summer, the first Giraffe in a Tesco store.
I'm conscious that these examples are a bit UK focused, but if you want an example of what we can achieve through repurposing the space let's take a little trip to Karlovy Vary in the Czech Republic, a classic example of a store built as big as possible rather than appropriately sized for the market. Before we remodeled it, an 80,000 square foot store, a 70,000 square foot mall.
We invested GBP1.6m, reduced the store by 30,000 square feet, rented the space to Sports Direct and C&A which, believe it or not, are destination-driving brands in the Czech Republic -- it sat a bit oddly when I wrote it. Anyway, we've also been able to improve the layout of the store. We've tightened the range. It's better for customers. It's cheaper to operate. It's got lower levels of waste, lower levels of lighting and energy and so on. But since the change footfall has increased by 25% because there's suddenly another reason for customers to come to the store and trading profit for the center's gone up by GBP0.5m already, that's pounds. It's one example, but the expected cash return from that investment is 30%.
Technology will be a key enabler in helping us to be a multi-channel leader. The pace of change in this area is truly exhilarating. More and more people in every market are using tablets and smartphones and mobile commerce is growing day by day. I see this as a massive opportunity.
We've made great strides this year. Our grocery home shopping capability is continuing to grow and can be easily deployed internationally. dunnhumby's insight is now back at the heart of the business, hardwired into decisions we make each and every day.
Our digital media businesses are about to merge with a great customer offer and Michael Cornish is here who we were fortunate to acquire when we bought his company Blinkbox just under two years ago now I think. We've added We7, a music streaming business and Mobcast, an ebook service, all are going to be rebranded in the next few months as Blinkbox and all available to Tesco customers.
People like Michael are changing the way the Company thinks about these challenges. You can make a lot out of the first curve, out of continuing to sell physical, but you can make a lot if you get there with the second curve, the digital and combine the two, which is just what we're doing. We've got an App development center in Shoreditch. It now produces for the entire Group. Our technology team now 5,000 engineers strong produce bespoke world-class software for the stores, for the internet and for the Bank, and they can go across the world. We're in a very strong position.
The third driver is the pursuit of disciplined international growth. The purpose of our international expansion is to exploit our skill and our scale in high-growth economies so we enhance returns relative to those available in the more mature markets. As such we're allocating our capital to those markets where we see sustainable advantage driven by the skill and the scale and by potential market leadership which underpins good returns. In all of them we're going to aim to be the multi-channel leader and you can see this in the good early progress we've made with online grocery operations in eight of our markets.
We're going to focus on our existing markets. We're going to think about their future potential in three groupings. First, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, three of our strength international businesses, in markets with significant future potential. Second, our European business, Ireland, Czech, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. Our clear priority here, build stronger businesses for customers, improve returns. Third, China, India and Turkey. Huge long term potential. Our focus is and it will remain on establishing clear profitable approaches to growth before committing significantly more capital in the future.
We've got strong positions in Korea, in Malaysia and Thailand but that shouldn't be confused with any sense that these markets are mature. Clearly we have an opportunity to build share. You can see from this chart that while we're number one in Malaysia and Thailand and number two in Korea there's still plenty of opportunity and they're all big markets with a combined modern grocery market share GBP75b today. But over the next four years alone the size of the industry is expected to grow by almost GBP20b, a real opportunity for Tesco to grow even if we just retain our current shares.
There are similarities for us with some more mature markets in Korea and Thailand. The majority of our hypermarket investment has been made and so convenience and online will be the key focus of our plans going forward. You may know that we already have over 1,100 Express stores in Thailand and that Korea has our largest dotcom operation in Asia, and that we've recently launched in Bangkok and KL. There are still opportunities for further hypermarket development in Malaysia but the pace of this development is tightly regulated.
The second group is Ireland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, markets where we're well-established but where our focus will be on holding our position and improving returns. Some of the CE markets like Hungary and Slovakia are faring better than others in terms of returns but, once again, our portfolio of hypers is largely complete and future capital investment in new space will be limited. Our focus in these markets is about making the most of the assets and driving further benefits from our skill and scale in areas such as joint buying and distribution. There's going to be some targeted investment in convenience and online but the amount of new space will be significantly reduced and our focus is on improving returns.
Now you would be right if you said --- well, that focus on growing returns in Europe is not a new thing for you to say. But the thing that's changes is our capital discipline. We're tightly constraining any future investment in this Group in order to provide unrelenting focus on these two objectives, holding our market share and improving returns.
The final Group is China, India and Turkey. The opportunities in all of these markets are clear but what connects them is that we're only going to pursue profitable growth not growth at any cost. We do have a good level in these markets. They are different to the US and Japan. But we'll take a measured approach as we aim to establish a model that delivers growth and returns.
So, as Laurie said, in China, for instance, we're focusing now on three regions, on developing a multi-channel offer, launching online food initially in Shanghai in the next few months. As you know, our model in India is to work with the Tata Group and we're unable to commit our own capital under the current regulations. It's fine. The model works. We like to partner and we're learning a lot about the market at very low cost to shareholders.
I'm saying this a lot but, to be clear, we will commit new capital to China and to Turkey but only for those opportunities that pass our rigorous investment appraisal targets. We'll be committing less capital in the coming years than we have in the past, at least until we can demonstrate a significant step forward in our objective of stronger returns.
Underpinning all of these drivers of growth, UK, multi-channel and international, is the strength of the new management team we've created, some of whom are here today, a largely new executive committee drawing on the potential of the strongest leaders within the organization complemented by some significant external hires. I'm confident the team we've got in place has the skill, the experience, the creativity and the drive to deliver on the three priorities I've just set out and to move quickly to seize the extraordinary opportunities which exist today.
Laurie's now going to talk you through the framework within which we're running and guiding the business and then I'll come and close and we can take your questions. Laurie?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you Philip. In 2012 and '13 we've made fundamental changes to our business, both commercially and financially, to set a new base from which Tesco can grow in a more productive manner. We've also laid out our approach to growth and returns which we are using to clarify our commitment to shareholders for the years ahead. We think this approach is realistic and appropriate given our multi-channel strategy. Importantly we think it's a framework that allows us to do a better job for both customers and shareholders.
Phil's taken you through this already, as you can see on the chart behind me, so I won't recap it point by point. But instead I'll explain why these are the right guiderails for Tesco and how we've arrived at these particular financial disciplines.
I'll start with growth, which has always been the central part of the investment case for Tesco. And to be clear, it is still at the core of the investment case but it's now a sustainable level of growth, a growth that enables us to deliver improving returns and a much stronger level of cash generation. In the past we delivered a much higher rate of growth. Initially this was driven by rapid and capital-intensive expansion overseas and in the UK. We also benefited from disruption elsewhere in the UK. In the recent past however it was sustained with too much short-term focus on the bottom line leading to some of the issues we have worked hard to address this year.
As such, the guidance we are sharing today is for mid-single digit trading profit growth and this reflects the balance I've talked about and of course takes into account the structurally changing retailing environment and the lower growth outlook for the economies and consumer spending around the world.
The building blocks of this sustainable level of growth are as follows. First we see the UK as a business that will focus on holding or growing its share through improving its existing assets. It will broaden its multi-channel reach, but new space growth will be about half the historic levels. So top line growth will be low to mid-single digit and this will translate into a similar level of bottom line growth. But while there are a number of factors which could contribute to a higher margin, it's our intention to reinvest any outperformance into improving our competitiveness. As we set out last year, we're comfortable to target the current level of UK trading margin going forward.
In Europe we see the difficult economic conditions persisting. In addition, we know we need to invest in our offer to do a better job competing with smaller format retailers and discounters. With capital strictly limited, which I'll return to shortly, and therefore a much lower contribution from new space, we see Europe's profit growth at the lower end.
Our biggest growth opportunity remains Asia where the economies are healthier and consumer confidence is higher. Once we are clear of the annualized effect of DIDA in South Korea, all our Asian markets have the potential to grow profits at the higher end of the range.
So UK low to mid, Europe lower end, and Asia higher end, leading to a mid-single digit growth overall. We're determined to achieve this growth in a balanced way and see the application of our financial disciplines as an important part of ensuring it's delivered in a way that supports strong sustainable and attractive returns going forward.
Firstly we'll tighten control over CapEx. There will likely be a very small increase in '13/'14 as we push on at a pace with our refresh plans in the UK. Following this we'll move quickly into and then down through the range we have set at 4% down to 3.5% of sales. Importantly this will enable us to move to a position where we can produce free cash flow without the historic requirements of property proceeds.
This is clearly a significant change from our historic cash flow shape. For a number of years we've relied on these proceeds to fund our investment as CapEx has exceeded available cash. We're getting close to a position where CapEx is broadly equivalent to the available cash and removing our reliance on these proceeds. From then on available cash grows, exceeds CapEx giving us a much greater flexibility from a cash point of view.
Not only are we more disciplined about the amount of CapEx we will invest, but we're also more disciplined in terms of the way that we allocate it. At its simplest level our planning process starts with all of our businesses set at the maintenance level of capital. We then review all of the opportunities presented to us by market and only those that can produce a better incremental set of returns which must be above our hurdle rate gets allocated capital.
In practice protecting our strong position in the UK is still one of our highest priorities. The best returns are now from refreshing our existing stores and investing in the broader multi-channel opportunities of convenience and online. Evidenced by our property write-down today we will not invest in those large store schemes where we see unacceptable returns. We will of course continue our process of making our existing large stores even more compelling destinations with the repurposing of space that Phil has described earlier.
Second is Asia where we still have very underdeveloped modern retail trade. We'll continue to strengthen our positions in Thailand, Malaysia and Korea. In China we still see a huge opportunity although our approach going forward is more measured and focused on standalone retail sites in the three regions where we have critical mass and good margins. We will build out the remaining 13 Lifespace malls but are not committing capital to any new freehold investments beyond these.
Finally, in Europe our large store networks are largely complete and we're effectively at a maintenance level of CapEx. Specific capital investment will be considered but these will be about improving the assets we have and expanding in low capital formats such as the Internet and convenience.
Now another way of looking at this which helps to explain why GBP3b is an appropriate base is to break it down by usage. First, we already have a significant amount of capital invested in the business around the world, largely in stores, which we depreciate over a long time, buildings for example over 40 years. As such, around GBP1.6b, similar to our level of depreciation, is required each year to maintain and refresh our stores.
Importantly we will increase investment in future capability to enable us to lead in the multi-channel area. So an important component of our capital spend is devoted to technology. This is not just pure digital assets but the improvements in technology which will enable us to create a seamless blend between our stores and online businesses and that represents GBP500m.
That leaves us with approximately GBP900m going into growth opportunities in Asia and the UK including around GBP500m of land which of course we don't depreciate. So this new base of CapEx achieves the right balance of maintaining our leadership position in the UK and funding new digital investment at an appropriate level for our expansion in growth markets. Importantly the allocation I've described will enable us to produce a steady improvement in return on capital employed from the current base within a range of 12% to 15%.
Even at the current base we're already one of the highest returning retailers in the world and, as you know, our weighted average cost of capital is around 7% so we're already creating significant shareholder value. At the high end this ROCE guiderails put is in a very elite club. Importantly, as most external analysis shows, there's a good correlation between returns and valuation multiple. In this way our focus on improving return on capital is a key driver to improving total shareholder return.
It is no accident that the majority of CapEx is going into those businesses that are already delivering our highest level of returns. As you can see here, although returns in the UK have been held back in the short term by the investment we have made to build a better Tesco, they're still the highest in the Group.
Next is Asia. The chart here includes Korea, Malaysia and Thailand, already high returning and these businesses are already delivering returns approaching the UK levels now. It will come as no surprise to you that the European returns have not moved forward given the external pressures. The priority here is to ensure the capital we have already invested in these markets moves to and exceeds the cost of capital.
Finally, the immature businesses, China, Turkey and India -- and China represents most of this chart -- as I've said we're going to invest here but only in the regions where we have scale and the opportunity to enhance returns. So more of our capital going into already high returning businesses and into driving forward returns in our immature businesses, all helpful to returns overall.
The level of investment we chose to make in the past did leave us with a weakened set of debt metrics and since becoming Finance Director I've made this my priority to improve. Obviously resetting the UK margin and the [DIDA] challenges in Korea and a disappointing profit performance in Europe have stalled the improvements we've made to date. That said, it's a high priority for the Group to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating and behind the framework we are laying out today my target on net indebtedness remains unchanged and it should be achieved within the next couple of years.
Fixed charge cover is more stubborn, not because our net debt isn't coming down but because our gross debt has long maturity periods. We do have GBP2b of debt we can potentially retire over the next three years. And secondly our lower level of sale and leasebacks will also help us slow down the rising rent bill. Both of these financial strategies will benefit the fixed charge cover.
Our improved cash flow growth will help a key credit rating measure, retained cash flow to adjusted net debt. This of course further underpins our commitment to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating.
Finally, dividends. They're an important discipline to us and I know how important they are to investors. Against the backdrop of our reduced earnings this year we've maintained the full-year dividend at 14.76p per share. This reflects our confidence in the business and the steps we've taken to resume growth in the future.
Going forward we believe it's right to make a renewed commitment to improving dividends in line with underlying earnings growth and scaling back our sale and leaseback program will impact underlying earnings due to the falling property profits in the near term. Therefore until property profits fall to an immaterial level we are planning to increase dividends in line with underlying earnings growth excluding the impact of property profits. This means that we'll be moving to a cover closer to two over the next few years and given our greater focus on cash this lower level of cover is more appropriate.
We'll update you on the progress against this framework at our next and subsequent result meetings. I'd now like to hand back to Phil.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Thank you. A year ago I stood here and I told you about the action we were taking to deal with the underperformance of the UK and the other challenges that we faced as a business. And although some of the challenges have been significant and new challenges have come along we've addressed them head-on, putting us in better shape for the future.
Much of our success over the past three decades has been the result of very bold investments that have provided a very strong inheritance for my team. A very strong online base. Clubcard, dunnhumby. Market leadership in six of our international businesses. A fantastically strong portfolio of locations. The last set of investments made in the mid-2000s before the world changed -- USA, Japan, more UK hypermarkets, the mixed use schemes -- they haven't done so well. Businesses which defer and pretend decisions that looked good before 2008 think they all look good today, they're in denial. We aren't in denial and that's why Tesco is stronger today than it was two years ago. It's a more focused Tesco. It's a Tesco fit for the multi-channel future.
Today's Tesco is once more led by customers, driven by our wonderful team, determined to strengthen at home and to build our international businesses carefully. We see customers are changing and we've changed too. A successful retailer in the future needs to offer customers what they want, when, where and how they want it. It isn't easy but we've the advantage. But when we're at our best Tesco is built around the needs of customers and thanks to our enormously powerful combination of geographies, of formats, of channels, and the quality of the team are placed to thrive in the new environment.
So to conclude, and before we take your questions, all of this is with the clearly stated objective that shareholders get improving returns and good dividend growth. So thank you for listening. I know it's been an hour but I thought it was worthwhile spending that time and Laurie and I are now very pleased to take your questions. I think you have microphones in front of you and if you can raise your hand and we'll, let's try Mr. Dorgan right at the beginning -- at the front rather.



================================================================================
Questions and Answers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Dorgan,  Panmure Gordon - Analyst    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you very much. I've actually got my mic' to work which is amazing. Thank you. Philip Dorgan at Panmure. I've just got a couple of questions. First of all, you seem very pleased with your Q4 performance in the UK. It doesn't look that good to me given that it's got the softest of comps. Can you explain the factors behind your pleasure?
The second question is given that the European markets will get low growth I can't quite understand why you're opening 300,000 square feet in Poland this year given the deterioration in returns.
And finally, when will Tesco Direct make money? What will be the drivers and if you could just remind me how much it's losing now? Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It just wouldn't be one of these meetings without you asking a question about Tesco Direct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Dorgan,  Panmure Gordon - Analyst    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The reason I'm pleased with Q4 is that we had a really good Christmas and did a great job for customers and then in January and February we didn't feel the need to blast coupons around to win back trade. So we're pleased with the way things went at Easter. The most important thing is the way customers are reacting. It was always going to take a bit of time this because you could see from the graph that Laurie showed like for like wasn't exactly going in the right way for quite a while and now we've stabilized it and we've got so much more that we know that we can do in 2013. It could have been very, very different.
On the European markets, 300,000 square feet in Poland, Laurie?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, so an important context I think, two years ago or 2011/'12 we were opening 2.7m square feet in Europe. We dropped that to 1.4m in the year just gone and we're moving to 400,000 square feet for the whole region in the coming year including the Republic of Ireland and Turkey. So that's a fairly major cut into the new space that's going into the market. Your specific question about Poland, we opened I think about 190,000 square feet in Poland in hypermarkets. It was three hypermarkets which we were already committed to so we had to open. They're actually trading pretty well and they've been sized more appropriately than 120,000, 100,000 square foot hypermarkets we've opened in the past.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Dorgan,  Panmure Gordon - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (Inaudible - microphone inaccessible).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The coming year it's 400,000 for the whole region.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Dorgan,  Panmure Gordon - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (Inaudible - microphone inaccessible).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, most of it going into smaller formats.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And Tesco Direct, it doesn't make any money, you know. We've never said how much. The reason it doesn't is it's not got to the scale and the reason it hasn't got to the scale is our general merchandise offer hasn't been good enough in the UK. And I'm disappointed with the general merchandise performance last year, but we have really gripped it now and my sense is that it's about to improve. And I set out the GM strategy when I was talking about the hypermarket strategy for the UK. So you can see where it's all heading and I think people, customers in particular, will begin to respond very positively to GM in stores and then that'll help us to do a better job online.
So I'm sorry I'm not going to give you the losses. I never have. I disclose enough as it is already.
Another question? Let's move over here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jerome Samuel,  HSBC - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, hello. Jerome Samuel, HSBC. A question on the US. So you confirm today the future exit. What kind of timeframe can we expect and more important the cash impact of that exit you expect?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you. Laurie is leading the process and the negotiations for us so, Laurie, do you want to just say a few words about that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. You'll appreciate there's a lot of commercial sensitivity around a process that I'm right in the middle of so just two weeks ago we received the first set of indicative offers from prospective buyers and it did generate a lot of interest. Encouragingly there are a number of organizations that want to buy the business in its entirety or virtually in its entirety so those are ones that we are pursuing with earnest. It's hard to put a specific date on when the process will be complete but it won't be within the next three months so we should mentally target that as the first, if you like, deadline.
And then importantly the end of your question, the indicative offers that we have received will mean that we will be getting out of the US without any further cash investment into the US to exit. Of course we do make a trading loss so we'll have to support the trading loss from now until we actually sell the business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jerome Samuel,  HSBC - Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. Thank you and a follow-up on international. International excluding the US represents about 35% of your Group profits now. Do you expect it to increase medium term or given what you've said you think it's going to plateau at this level?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I think we've been pretty clear in terms of our expectations in the financial guiderails to say that Europe's going to be at the low end of single-digit growth and Asia's going to be at the higher end of single-digit growth. And ex one-time effects like the annualized effect of [DIDA] in Asia but also the historic one-time issues I mentioned in my speech in Turkey and the crisis tax in Hungary, that's going to be the shape of those two regions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jerome Samuel,  HSBC - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Kershaw,  Exane BNP Paribas - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    John Kershaw from Exane. Just a couple. On the returns side, first of all thanks for the welcome candor on that. But in terms of if it is going to be more capital discipline, less CapEx, are you not still in too many markets because you know well that you need to fight for leadership to drive those returns? So can we not expect perhaps market exits to come or give us some more color on that?
And then in terms of the guiderails, 12% to 15%, is that a case of down before up because of the tough macro and a bit more to go or is it a new realization of multi-channel returns will be lower in aggregate for the Group?
And then finally, given Dorgy's touched on Q4 trading, just more broadly can you put some numbers to online profitability because it's clearly your future? You've given us what we sort of knew already. What we're looking for is numbers, you know, as we're simple souls.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Market exit. We're out of the market. I didn't think would be able to provide a right blend of growth and returns that I want to deliver for shareholders. I don't believe it will be necessary to exit any others.
The European markets are perhaps the most challenging for reasons that it's the first time those consumers have actually felt recession since the end of communism and rising unemployment and everything that you'll know about austerity. But two of them are market leaders with more than 25% share of the market. Two of them are second or third in the market in markets that have really been hit very hard. And one is Turkey which we put into the third grouping. We're not putting a lot of capital behind Turkey until we find a model that we think can win.
And again, in the sake of candor, we're disappointed with Europe. In part the economies haven't helped. In part we haven't helped ourselves and receiving considerable attention at the moment for that reason. The fact that Czech, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary are continuing, because you've heard us talk often I think about getting some more synergies out of it, well, we're absolutely on that as we speak.
Laurie's going to take the guiderail question about ROCE and then I'll just finish on Q4 trading.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So they're guiderails, John, the 12% to 15%. As you imply, we're already above the bottom of it at 12.7%. And it's our intention and our planning assumption that in balance with controlling capital and getting mid-single digit growth in earnings that returns will gradually tick up over time. So not going back.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    No, no. Thanks Laurie. So in the Q4 trading question we got to what is the grocery home shopping profitability I think. It is profitable but I'm not going to give the number today. We keep being asked this question so at some point we're going to have to, but we'll do it at the right time and when we're ready for it, and we need to think about the implications of that. The Central European businesses which have only been running for seven months are already breaking even at a cash level. And the UK does much better than that, much, much better than that.
Another question. We'll go right to the back if we may. Thank you and then I'll come back towards the front.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James Grzinic,  Jefferies - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, thanks. It's James Grzinic from Jefferies. I had two. The first one was just looking at page 63 you seem to assume that there will be a big bounce in operating cash flow already from this year. Can you help us? It looks about GBP1b. What are the component parts of that? How much of that is working capital, non-repeats of exceptionals? How much is Fresh & Easy and perhaps if you can tell us how much for the negative Fresh & Easy was in the past year?
And in terms of space plans for the UK, you're still going to put down 700,000 square feet of Extra space, hypermarket space this year. Is that mostly reflective of contractual obligations? Should we expect that to go down drastically the year after next?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    While we're trying to find page 63 and Chris is about to do that --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I'll have a go in terms of the operating cash flows.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    He wrote the book. Thank you very much, that's great. I'll just do the 700,000 square foot of Extras and what's going to happen in the future. I'm going to do the --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    You go first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Have you got that answer yet? I was giving you some time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you give me 30 seconds that will be very helpful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    He still can't find 63. You've put me off now. It will be hard for people to believe that Tesco has places in the UK where it doesn't have a presence but it is true. And someone's going to snigger when I say Prestatyn. Our market share in Prestatyn was about 1% or 2% (technical difficulty) opened the food superstore there with a clothing department nine weeks ago.
And the stores that you're seeing us open in this year and in future years are going to be in places where we don't have a store or the store that we have isn't fit for the future. So let's just think about Sunderland and I know people don't want to think much about Sunderland but some of us unfortunately have to. Sunderland has a Metro. When I was the RMD in the north of England we had a 10,000 square foot Metro which is what we have today. We're opening a center of town hypermarket. Gateshead, 35,000 square foot store opened 35 years ago. We're closing it. We're opening a new Extra 70,000 square feet, flat free car parking. And so on.
So the Extras are in places where we are not. Some of them are replacements so upgrading an existing store that isn't competing -- isn't competitive. All positioned nicely for the multi-channel opportunity. And in future years that's what you'll see us do. But we won't be opening 2.5m square feet of them. They're not going to be 150,000 square feet. They're going to be more like about 70,000 to 80,000 square feet and there'll be fewer of them. And what we'll do in future communications, we'll lay out which the stores are and then you'll all see the perfect sense of it and why.
So Laurie, have you got that page 63 yet?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I have. Sorry James, we managed to confuse ourselves because we had a different numbering on the charts than the book that you've got and of course I know page 63. I think it's first important in context to explain the operating cash flow for the retail business this year so you can understand what grows next year. So the trading performance of the Group did go backwards and that took about GBP0.5b, GBP500m, out of our cash flow year on year. And then working capital for the retail business, which I'll come back to, declined by about GBP500m and then we paid about GBP200m into the pension fund. So that was a GBP1.2b outflow for the retail business.
Now of course our intention is to grow next year so we don't have the drag of the retail business going backwards and we intend to improve our working capital going forward. We don't need to pay another payment into the pension.
There's a related question, why did working capital go backwards in the year? Actually our stock performance was fine but our creditor performance did decline. And there were two key impacts here. The first was to try and reduce stock, and as I say we didn't, we moved some of our general merchandise sourcing from long lead time Asia to shorter lead time in Europe and that did reduce the lead time, it also reduced the creditor days but it didn't reduce the stock so we had a degradation in our creditor days for that.
The second area is a little bit more sensitive because I don't want to refer to specific countries but there is a country in Asia and there are certain countries in Central Europe where the regulator is very focused upon organizations trying to extend their credit terms, in fact pressure to reduce it. We've complied with that.
Importantly, and I know this is irritating for you, but the most important thing for me to do on working capital is to improve it all the way through the year, not when I report back to you. So actually -- because that's the thing obviously that drives the overdraft at the bank and that's the thing that drives the interest. Now importantly the working capital performance through the year was much better than in the prior year. In fact our outflow on average was flat. We didn't have an outflow on average. It was just a poorer performance at the end of the financial year than we were planning.
So we should see an improvement in working capital. Indeed it's a great focus for all of our businesses in the coming year. And we should see trading profit performance growth. And that's the thing that starts to make the cash flow growth with the same level of CapEx.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James Grzinic,  Jefferies - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks for that. And just to clarify, once Fresh & Easy is deconsolidated out of the cash flow how much of a drag are you taking out of the operating cash flow? Because I presume over the past year you would have been strongly negative even if you reduced CapEx.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For the US, yes, a couple of hundred million.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pounds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pounds, yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Another question please. We'll stay at the back on the right-hand side here. Yes?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sreedhar Mahamkali,  Macquarie - Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes, hi. It's Sreedhar Mahamkali from Macquarie. Three questions then please. Firstly, are you now comfortable that the UK recovery is fully on track and that you will actually be reporting positive like-for-likes through the year in the context of something like 1% like-for-like in consensus, driven by food of course? That's the first question please.
And secondly, can you talk a little bit more about non-food, particularly profitability in the context of UK margin, how dilutive non-food is and what can you do there?
In the context of non-food again, on slide 64 -- not sure what slide number that is in your pack -- on slide 64 where you talk about resetting the space, there is no reference to electricals on that chart. How much space is there in electricals and is that all going to disappear?
And finally losses in Turkey.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Four questions?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sreedhar Mahamkali,  Macquarie - Analyst    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    I should have said three areas.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sorry. Alright.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sreedhar Mahamkali,  Macquarie - Analyst    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sorry. Losses in Turkey, how much are they and what's your plan for next year? Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Do you want me to do that first?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    So Turkey first I'll do Sreedhar. The losses in Turkey, 10s of millions, disappointing because we were making a profit in the prior year. Mainly driven by the underlying performance of negative sales and a pressure on our gross food margin. And I referenced a couple of one-time historic issues in my speech. They both impact stock and margin so ultimately margin and because of the slowdown in the growth of the business the ageing of stock was making me uncomfortable so we've actually taken a charge on the age of stock specific to Turkey.
And then secondly we have a number of outstanding disputes with suppliers which we've taken in our favor as a credit in our balance sheet and again because of the slowdown of growth and retrenching I wasn't 100% confident that we would get that money and be able to book it as cash so I've taken about GBP20m for those two charges.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks. I'm going to take the one about like-for-like for the year and one about non-food profitability and then I'm going to ask Chris Bush who's here, the new MD of the UK, many of you will know, just to talk about the ideas we've got for consumer electronics. Yes we're planning to have a positive like-for-like performance in the year.
On non-food profitability, we've got a very profitable clothing business and some elements of our general merchandise are nicely profitable. But going back to Philip Dorgan's question about Direct and about general merchandise in general, in the stores and online we're heavily dependent for the sales line on consumer electronics which just don't generate much of a profit so they're dilutive. So GM can become non-dilutive. It is dilutive now. And that's the plan that we have set out for the next year with some seriousness I hasten to add. And customers and you will see changes in our stores, in many of our stores and in our online offering during the course of the year. We feel once and for all we've gripped it.
So Chris, do you want to just say a little bit about what you're planning to do with electrical space in stores? And here's Chris. There you go.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Bush,  Tesco plc - UK MD    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It doesn't quite reach. Can you hear me? Can you hear me without the microphone? Is that okay? I think we're taking a good hard look at what we're doing with general merchandising in all of our stores.
And in small stores, those superstores that you will be familiar with, what's clear to us is that customers want a consumable range of general merchandise and a range of products that they would expect to buy in a distressed purchase. And at the moment the range in some of those stores includes things like televisions. And customers tell us in those stores that they don't actually want to buy a television. So we're revamping the range and you'll see that as we go through this year, a much more appropriate range of general merchandising in stores between 10,000 square feet and 50,000 square feet.
In the bigger more destinational stores we need to be clear on where we want to compete and where we want to win, and I think we are. We're getting our act together on developing a very compelling offer in those areas. And on electrical that will mean that in some categories in electrical you'll see us turn down our efforts and in some categories in electrical we'll turn up our efforts. Digitalization is with us today and it's going to be with us tomorrow. You won't see a Tesco store over 50,000 square feet that won't be selling digital applications because that would be clearly wrong for what we stand for.
So it is a bit of reshaping. It's work in progress. You'll some change this year. You'll see more change next year. But we're confident and clear it's the right thing for the future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks Chris. So we'll come back to the front now. I know you've been very patient, Andrew, so over to you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Kasoulis,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Andrew Kasoulis from Credit Suisse. One question. Your debt and financial charge targets, can you clarify whether or not you need to achieve those before you potentially make a share buyback please?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Laurie?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our focus over the next two years is strengthening the balance sheet and read into that that we want to be a strong investment credit rating. At the moment with Standard & Poor's and Fitch we're on negative outlook, but we are an A rated company. And with Moody's we're top of the B rating, BBB plus on a stable outlook. And we're not comfortable with that position. We'd like that to be a lot stronger.
Now actually the financial metrics for the majority of the credit rating agencies we're actually in a not unreasonable position. Of course about 30% of their view comes from intangibles, strength of market share, strength of business, strength of margin growth. And a lot of the natural consequences of our strategy to some put a negative spin on that. So we've got to make sure that not only the financial measures get stronger but actually underlying the performance of the business comes through. And once we've done that then yes in two years' time, that's roughly the timeframe. We've got flexibility to discuss what we want to do with excess cash, but I'd like to wait until then to have that conversation.
I think we're doing a good job on dividends to be honest. As you saw, our cover's going to drop from 2.7 times cover to closer to 2 over a very short period of time. So that gives you confidence that our cash flow growth is coming through in terms of our own internal plans.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Another question?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marc de Speville,  Redburn Partners - Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Marc de Speville at Redburn. Just one question for you Phil. Can you give us some idea of your vision for why people should shop at Tesco versus competitors and specifically I'm thinking how much do you think you should and you can improve in all the key areas of service -- and you showed some progress on internal surveys there -- and value and quality? And how high do you think you can and should be aiming? What's your vision as what's going to make Tesco great again for customers? Simple one question.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. My answer is that I want us to become the benchmark again. There was a time when we were and now I don't really think that we are. And that requires better quality. It requires better service. It requires better promotions, better stores. It's just building a better Tesco. We intend to be the benchmark. The benchmark for the best value-for-money retailer, that alchemy between the price you pay and the quality you receive, but with quality as absolutely the underpin, absolutely. And we made so much progress here in a year. I thank the team who are here because they're the people who've really made it happen for us.
And as we bring new people into the organization, we're doing a lot of that, and as we allow younger people to come through, we're doing a lot of that, they're coming with a completely different set of expectations about what they want to do. We've relaunched our fresh meat and poultry and seafood range in the UK twice in 25 weeks, twice. We haven't actually done it for four years. Chris is in the merchandising center every week here in the UK looking at the way products are merchandised, the way the ranges are put together. We're going back to what we used to do. We're going back with a new team. We're going to be the benchmark and that's what will get us back to leading.
And Laurie's just scribbled here, don't forget to mention, bringing the Tolleys who are the people who run Harris and Hoole for us. Getting Michael Holmes to get hold of Giraffe for us and bring in Russell and his team. These are all changing the way the organization is behaving and thinking. We've tried to do bakery well for years. Euphorium shows us the way. We tried to do digital video with a product called Tesco Connect. It was the first thing I canned very quietly. Three years of development, never really got to market, but we were very fortunate to get Michael Cornish and his team and they've built us a really great offer. We couldn't have done it without that.
So that's what helps you be the benchmark. You change the organization because of the people. You allow them to come through. We will be the benchmark again. We've only just begun.
Let's go right to the very back and then we'll come down to Dave McCarthy after the guy at the back.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unidentified Audience Member    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    All the way from Merseyside. Two questions please. Firstly, can you give us an indication what the sales uplifts have been on the stores you've refreshed this year and what that contribution may have been to the UK like-for-like sales?
And secondly, can you give us a feel for your expectations from the Bank over the medium term and whether there are any particular levers or thresholds that may lead the bank's profitability to grow?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay, thank you. Benny Higgins is here who is the CEO of Tesco Bank so I'll let him say a little bit about the Bank in a moment.
We've refreshed 300 stores in the UK in the last year and we experimented a lot with the new Express treatment in London which Andrew Yaxley, who's also here, is now leading because Andrew's got the job of helping us do the right thing for London customers, got all formats. We're getting -- in terms of contribution to the overall like-for-like, I don't have it at hand; we can get it -- but we're getting a couple of per cent uplift overall out of Expresses and Superstores are probably better than that, and the new ones even better than that. So that's why we're putting a bit more into refresh.
You see I don't think customers are getting the opportunity to see the best of Tesco in all locations and that's our idea. It's going to take us a few years and some of the stuff that Chris and Andrew and others are doing is staggeringly good. And one of the big things will now be to make sure we get that to more stores, the range, the new space allocations and so on.
On the Bank, have we got a microphone for -- it's coming round for Benny and what do you reckon Benny? Benny now is a member of the Tesco executive team. He used to just be up in Edinburgh but now we make him come down to Cheshunt and do some work from time to time. Benny?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benny Higgins,  Tesco plc - CEO, Tesco Bank    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thanks a lot Philip. That was my appraisal. I feel very optimistic, Clive, about the future for the Bank and why do I say that? Four years ago we got full control of the business. We had 200 people and we were renting accommodation from RBS. We had no systems. We were basically leaning on RBS for both our banking and our insurance.
Today we've got four major centers, two in Edinburgh, one in Glasgow, one in Newcastle. We have 4,000 people. We are in control of our own destiny. One of the first things we did when we took control of those service centers was to remove incentives and targets for people dealing with customers on the phone. I spent all morning in Newcastle yesterday and it's transformed the atmosphere. People in that business, our people, are focused on looking after customers.
The best way I think to calibrate how well a business is doing and what the wellbeing of it is to say, ask yourself what are the customers doing. If you look at the last 12 months our customer accounts have risen to 6.6m. If you look at our principal main accounts it rose by 15% and annualized 20% in the second half. If you look at how much savings Tesco customers place with us and trust us, that rose by 12% last year. If you look at the lending products, credit cards and loans in particular, you see a 16% increase in Tesco customers borrowing from us.
I think we've got very strong people who are in the business. It's a business that -- I've learned a lot by being part of Tesco about what it means to start with the customer and work through to what you need to do to run the business. That's how we're running the business and I think what Philip alluded to earlier is the most powerful thing for me. We're not just another part of a profit pool. We are an essential part of making Tesco a better business with broader and deeper relationships so I'm very optimistic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you. Near term we've taken a bit of a hit from insurance. That's been very difficult for us. Benny's now focused much more on our customers rather than just going out and buying customers who aren't ours. And PPI has taken the industry hard and we've had to take a charge this year. We hope that's the last one, but you never know. I'm getting phone calls every day. And Anna, my assistant, who's here, keeps ringing them up telling them not to ring me and ask if I want to go and do some ambulance chasing, but they keep on coming at me.
I'm particularly excited by the personal current account launch in 2014 because when we got into banking all those years ago, customers said we'd like you to be a bank because you'd be a very, very good bank. But when we say to customers you know we're a bank, they say well you haven't got current accounts so you're not really a bank yet. So you can see how we're thinking about it in the future.
David?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave McCarthy,  Investec - Analyst    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. Thanks Philip. I just wanted to drill a bit deeper on the property write-downs. You've got GBP800m of write-downs on 100 properties you've owned for five to 10 years. How many of those have got planning permission? What are you going to do with them? Are you prepared to sell them to your competition?
And what does this mean for your capitalized interest as well because you've clearly capitalized GBP800m for a number of years. Are you going to be stopping doing that? So presumably your capitalized interest is going to come right back this year which will impact your profits.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Do you want to do the capitalized interest bit because I like talking about the stores bit?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. The specific write-down of the WIP within the GBP804,000 --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Million.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laurie McIlwee,  Tesco plc - CFO    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    GBP804m is GBP570m specific to the WIP. So it's that area that, as you say, will mean that our P&L charge for interest will go up because a proportion of it will be capitalized. And you can roughly take 5% of GBP570m, so it's a GBP25m hit to the interest line. Of course the cash flow line doesn't change at all.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you. Some have planning permission. Many don't. Some of the mixed use schemes which are the -- what we did is we stood back and said look, we've got a great pipeline of properties we've built up for the future, which ones are fit for the future? That was the starting point. Which are in places we want to be in? Which are in places we don't think we need to be in? Which are going to get us a return? And that was the starting. But it wasn't how much is in there. It was what is it and do you want it?
So we are going to open a store in Kirby because we haven't got one. And it's not going to be 110,000 square foot with 1m square foot of retail. It's going to be about 70,000 square feet with some associated big boxes next to it and that's it. But we're in for most of -- for more there. So we're writing down the alternative use value of the other land that we've got around it, therefore you get a charge.
And we've ended up with a great group of stores we're confident we can built out and a group we don't think that we can. And we've been slowly but surely removing our interest from those in the last few months. And that's culminated in this charge today. You'll see more of that in the future. Some of them might be taken by competitors because they're going to be in places that we are, we don't think we need to be or we don't think we're going to get a return. But we've taken them down to the alternative use value and we think it's the right thing to do because we don't want to be opening just for the sake of it. We want to be open in the right places with the right stores.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave McCarthy,  Investec - Analyst    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Just going back on that, so you're going to take them down to alternative use value but you might sell them to the competition. Are you prepared to sell them to a property developer and then they sell them and they make the profit?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Having looked at each of the schemes, the chances of that are extremely remote. However, if it comes to that, that's what we will do.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave McCarthy,  Investec - Analyst    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. And the other bit I was surprised --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    And the alternative use value in that case will be we think we're going to sell it to a developer because we think he's going to sell it on, not it's just going to go and be fallow land for 15 years.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave McCarthy,  Investec - Analyst    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Okay. The other bit I was surprised on is two aspects, one that you've got properties with planning permission that you've not been developing and you've just been sitting on because there've been commitments from Tesco in the past to the competition authorities that was not the case. And secondly, the extent of the write-down shows that you've been paying for properties that don't have planning permission and you've been paying a premium over alternative use for it. So it just seems the worst of both worlds in two cases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On the first point, we've been sitting on properties with planning permission, you actually can't sit on it for very long because you lose the planning permission, as you probably know. So there aren't very many of those. But there were local authorities who were minded to give permission but we've subsequently decided we don't want to be there, because you know the way planning works; you have to have a recommendation by the local planners to the planning authority. And so we had very clear desires by planning officers that we would build out a store for them and we now concluded that we won't.
So it wasn't that we gaily went about buying land where we didn't think there was an opportunity. We only made investments where we thought that there would be and where we had pretty good indications that that would be the case, which is why they might end up going off to somebody else, although I think, as I said, unlikely having looked at the individual schemes.
So what was the second part of your question, so the write-down is --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dave McCarthy,  Investec - Analyst    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The second was that you seemed to have a very large write-down for properties that you've bought without planning permission because historically you would buy a piece of land for, say, GBP1m subject to it gaining planning permission and then you'd pay the GBP20m.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. So it's the same answer really, David, because we only buy when we know we have the option that it can be turned into a planning permission. Many of these were bought 2005, 2000, 2007, 2008, before the world changed, before the Internet. And planning officers have also changed their views in that time. So we're confident that we exercised the right level of control but for a different era and a different world. And you know, I hope, that I'm sincere when we say what we're going to do. We're going to build out the right stores in the right place, and that has meant that we've decided that some of them that we could do, we're not going to do.
Thank you. Jaime? Yes. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jaime Vazquez,  JP Morgan - Analyst    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. Jaime Vasquez from JP Morgan. You have repeatedly alluded to the world has changed and that affects the format you choose for future expansion. That change in the world should also have an impact in the shopping malls that you have outside the UK. First of all the question is what is the value of that mall? You have very kindly valued the UK property at GBP20b. What's the value of your international malls?
And secondly, is it not time to start monetizing that value actively considering the change of the world?
And secondly, can you please quantify the Chinese losses, or at least whether they went up last year and what the outlook for this year would be. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Chinese losses came down last year as a consequence of the focus that we put on not building out in places where you just don't get growth and immediate profits. So they came down. Still loss-making, but they came down.
On the malls, we don't give a value to them and we're not going to be monetizing them either. The thing about Asia in particular, but also about Europe, is our customers want to go to a shopping mall. And if it's anchored by a hypermarket it's another reason for going to the mall and to the hypermarket. So we always refresh. Take Karlovy Vary, that one example of Srinakarin in Thailand, in [Yong Dong-Po] in Korea. What we do is we're always refreshing the offer. And it's that which creates the impetus and makes it to continue to be an attractive destination. We see the two as having very symbiotic relationship and absolutely we need to keep on managing them actively, which is what we're doing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edouard Aubin,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Yes. Sorry. Edouard Aubin from Morgan Stanley. So just to follow up on the real estate question on the hypermarkets. So you've talked about the opportunity to downsize some of your hypermarkets in the UK and abroad. Could you just quantify a little bit what's the opportunity over the next two, three years? You have, I think you're going to have something like 17m square foot of hypermarket selling space in the UK by Feb '14. So could you just give us a sense of what could be the magnitude?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Thank you. By the way, I've only got time for one more question after this because we've got to go off, so I'm sorry about that, those of you who wanted to ask a question and couldn't.
In the UK, hypermarkets for us start at 60,000 square feet of selling and go up to, in the case of Horwich about 130,000 square feet is our biggest store. But only 50 of the hypermarkets are over 80,000 square feet. So the opportunity is the 50 over 80,000 square feet. And some of them we don't need to downsize at all because they're in amazing locations, normally in major cities and they're just doing very well. So we'll move, tinker at the edges of those. So you can see a few a year, not a huge number. 10 years' time when we look back, I think most of them will have had some space change, the 50.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edouard Aubin,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Can you place that change outside the UK?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Philip Clarke,  Tesco plc - Group Chief Executive    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hardly any in Asia, largely in Central Europe. And it's largely those 8s and 10s and 15s. So 80,000 square feet, 100,000 square feet, 150,000 square feet that we opened a decade ago. So the Karlovy Vary example, over the next few years, 20 of those I think are within our sights. And they pay back very quickly and they make the shop better for customers because the worst thing is going through in a store which is short of customers and big on space.
So we've got chance for one last question and we'll go over here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James Anstead,  Barclays - Analyst    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    James Anstead from Barclays. Just two questions. Firstly on ROCE, I think since 2006 you've always given us a very specific target for ROCE and now it's widened to quite a wide range of 12% to 15%, even though you've actually eliminated a couple of the hard-to-predict elements, like Fresh & Easy, for example. So why is it that you're still giving us really quite a wide range of outcomes there?
And then secondly on Central Europe, you've had a 40% cut on (technical difficulty) this year. And if you look at, I forget which chart it is, but you've talked about pretty low single-digit growth for Central European or European profits going forward. Is there any kind of improvement we should expect before you get onto that low growth number going forward or have profits in Europe really been fundamentally rebased down quite severely?

    I'll take the second question first and let Laurie take the first on ROCE. You should expect progress in Central Europe in 2013/2014. We -- I said part of the problem was the consumer. Part of the problem was us. Some of it was one-time issues. So we expect progress in Central Europe in '13/'14.

    I think the critical point, James, is that the range that we've given you of 12% to 15%, both are very good ROCEs. We need to have that firmly in our head. And we've said clearly and I've replied to one of the questions today that our objective and the way that we're planning is for our ROCE to improve gradually through those guiderails. So that's the guidance that we're giving you. And also at 15%, if that's where we eventually get to in the future, that is a very, very good return on capital employed. I think actually there's only one other retailer that I can think of that's got a return anywhere close to that.
With regard to the second bit of your question, the specificity of 14.6% and a date, that was set in a different era. That was set in an era before the reset of the UK margin. It was set before the impact on our opening hours in South Korea. And it was certainly set ahead of the multi-channel strategy that we're pursuing in both [CRICs] and BRICs. So we don't think that's an appropriate message to give you going forward. And the guiderail and the framework of 15% to 12% is a much better way of telling you how we're going to drive total shareholder value in the future.
