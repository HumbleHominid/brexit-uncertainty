Presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Deutsche Post DHL conference call regarding DP DHL first quarter results 2013.  At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode.  The floor will be open for questions, following the presentation.
Let me now turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Martin Ziegenbalg.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.  Hello, and very good day, or good morning to those in the US, to our Q1 conference call.  It's a busy reporting day for you out there, so let's start right with the presentation by our CFO, Larry Rosen.  The presentation, I take it, you have in front of you.  After that, as usual, we will have sufficient time for Q&A.
With that, I'd like to ask Larry to start, please.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Martin.  Good afternoon to everybody.  Good morning to those joining from the US, or Latin America.  Thanks for joining the call today to review our performance for Q1.
Let's get started right away, and have a look at the highlights for the quarter, on page 2.  Overall, we're very pleased with our performance in Q1, in particular, against the backdrop of a still challenging macroeconomic environment.
Global real GDP growth in Q1 was only around 2%, against our original, and still current, low expectations of 2.5% to 3% for the full year.  Nonetheless, we were able to continue capitalizing on our strategic and structural advantages to deliver a very solid quarter in terms of financial performance.
We were particularly pleased to have made progress on increasing Express margin with our significantly improved cash flow performance.  Our guidance for the year remains unchanged, and I'll review the details later in the presentation.
Now, over on page 3 you see that the trends of the last several quarters have continued in Q1 with very strong volume growth in Express TDI, and in the German domestic parcel business.  In contrast, both our volume and the entire market in air freight continued to decline, reflecting the weak economic environment.
On the bottom of the chart, you can see we had a solid margin development in DHL with an increase in Express, and basically flat margin in Global Forwarding and Supply Chain, consistent with the top line development in these two businesses.
Now, on page 4, let's look at P&L for Q1.  Reported revenue growth was only 0.6%, though in the quarter we had some light currency headwinds.  We also had fewer working days, which, in particular, affected the Mail business and the Express business.  And we had the effect of divestitures from last year, in particular, the Australian and New Zealand domestic express businesses.
EBIT was up around 3% as growth in DHL could offset a very slight decline in Mail.
Our financial result was good, but reflects the positive effect we had in Q1 of last year related to the final Postbank transaction accounting.
The tax rate developed favorably with a 22% effective tax rate for the quarter, and was lower than expected due to the results of some pending tax audits.  And we now expect the rate for the year to be around 22%.
Net profit would have been up by about 46% compared to last year excluding the mentioned Postbank transaction accounting effect.
Page 5, you see our cash flow development.  We were especially pleased with our performance in the quarter with about a EUR500 million swing to the positive side compared to Q1 of last year.
In addition to the increased EBIT, the main contributor was working capital, where our payables, receivable, and receivables management were good compared to last year.  And you may also remember that we terminated a factoring program in Q1 of last year, resulting in a cash outflow of around EUR140 million last year.
The absolute negative free cash flow reflects, as usual, the once-a-year payment of around EUR540 million that we make every year in January for the civil servant pension arrangement with the German Government.
On page 6, you see the evolution of our net debt.  And you see that we had a small increase in net debt, reflecting especially that civil servant pension payment that I just mentioned, and also a negative effect from derivative valuation.
Overall, we're well on track to achieve the guidance we've given for this year, to generate sufficient free cash flow to, at a very minimum, cover the dividend payment that we anticipate making in May, end of this month.
On page 7, a reminder that as of Q1 this year we have a new accounting standard in force, and that's IAS 19R.  The new standard introduces important changes in accounting for pension and other employee benefits.  In summary, unrecognized losses, primarily resulting from lower discount rates, were added to the pension liability and charged against equity.
Overall, we expect the changes to be neutral for operating income, or EBIT, while our financial expense and net income should benefit from the EUR2 billion funding executed in Q4 last year, as well as the lower discount rates.  And, of course, there is no cash effect from this accounting standard change.
On page 8, we'll start to take a look at our divisions, and begin with the Mail division.  We saw several cross currents in the Mail business in Q1.  On the positive side, we implemented the first stamp price increase in Germany in the last 15 years, and the parcel business continued to develop very well with double-digit volume growth per day, yet again.
On the other hand, the timing of the Easter holiday gave us 2.6 working days less than in the quarter compared to last year.  And our wage costs were 4% higher year over year since the previous wage agreement increase began on April 1, last year.  So the wage agreement actually started on January 1, but the 4% increase began on April 1.
On page 9, we see that overall for the Mail business our top line grew slightly due to the stamp price increase, and the higher parcel revenues.  Offsetting the 2.6 day working day deficit in Q1 will be the one additional day in each of Q2 and Q3.
EBIT was slightly down as the stamp price increase and the strong parcel performance could not quite offset the wage increase and the lower number of working days.
Cash flow performance was excellent as we had a very good evolution in working capital levels, and last year's Q1 included the termination of that factoring program I referred to before, which resulted in a cash outflow of EUR139 million last year.
On page 10, I want to give you a feeling for our very proactive approach to maximize the benefits of the structural trends driving parcel growth.  We believe the parcel business will be a growth market for the foreseeable future, and, as the market leader, we're doing a number of things proactively to both increase the size of our overall market, and also to enhance our own position.
We're expanding the number of delivery options, in particular, by upgrading our pack station network.  We're actively enabling the successful increase in the number of categories suitable for a parcel.  We're investing in a very large upgrade of all our parcel sorting facilities to allow both higher capacity and to allow for faster sorting and faster delivery of the increased volumes.  And we're also enhancing our import/export service capabilities for international B2C business, both into and out of Germany.
On page 11, you see that the Express division had a very good start to the year with both continued well-above market core TDI volume growth, and a higher EBIT margin.  All regions participated in the strong volume growth as a result of the upgrades to our network and service capabilities of the last several years.
On page 12, we see the summary of financials for Express.  Top line growth was muted due to a lower number of working days, currency headwinds, and the divestitures we had last year of the domestic businesses in Australia and New Zealand.  However, operating income increased by almost 10%.
And the EBIT margin increased 8.4%, or 8.0% adjusting for the EUR12 million disposal gain we had on the sale of the Romanian domestic express business.
Cash flow conversion improved substantially due to better working capital trends, and also lower cash outs for restructuring.
On page 13, the old adage of a picture being worth a thousand words certainly applies here.  Certainly, it does for me.  Clearly, our leadership in the highest growth markets provides us a continued structural opportunity to grow the fastest in the industry; and it is certainly true in Asia, where we're the clear leader in all our important markets.  That's important because more than 50% of worldwide volumes touch Asia, either imports, exports, or shipments cross-border within the region.
On page 14, we now have a look at our Global Forwarding business, where we've seen a continuation of the trend established already actually for many quarters.
The air freight market has seen negative growth in Q1 due to structural weakness, in particular, in technology, and also a shift to ocean freight as there's less need for speed in the overall soft economic environment.  In addition, our still selective business strategy leads currently to even more volume decline compared to the overall market, which, we estimate, declined around 2% in Q1; but it allows us to preserve the still attractive gross profit margins in both air and ocean freight.
We're making good progress on achieving efficiencies in overhead cost management, and also our continuing implementation of NFE, the new IT environment for Global Forwarding.
On page 15, you see that even though we had a slight top line decline of around 2%, absolute EBIT and EBIT margin could be maintained at last year's level due especially to the mentioned selective strategy, and also cost management.
Spending on NFE was roughly flat year over year.  But OpEx and CapEx is proceeding according to plan and we still do expect a high double-digit increase in spending on NFE compared to last year.
On page 16, we look at the supply chain business, where we had moderate growth for the quarter, driven especially by automotive, retail and our relatively new airport solutions business.
Good growth in emerging markets was offset by weaker trends, especially in Europe.  A very positive highlight was the record level of new business wins at EUR430 million; more than double the level of last year's Q1, so it's a record for a first quarter of a year.
On page 17, supply chain EBIT for the quarter was down due to a charge related to a customer bankruptcy, a Chapter 11 filing in the US, where we had to write off around EUR12 million of receivables.  Without that charge, EBIT would have actually increased slightly.
Also, supply chain delivered a strong cash flow performance for the quarter.
On page 18, we review the detailed guidance for the year, which remains unchanged at EUR2.7 billion to EUR2.95 billion of EBIT.  That includes EUR1.1 billion to EUR1.2 billion for Mail; EUR2 billion to EUR2.15 billion for DHL; and around EUR400 million for corporate center costs.
After our very good cash flow performance in Q1, we remain confident to generate, at a very minimum, sufficient cash flow to cover this year's dividend.
After a slow start in Q1, we still do expect to spend around EUR1.8 billion in CapEx, though that should now probably be viewed as a maximum amount.
Helped by a lower tax rate, net income growth should at least be roughly in line with growth in operating income.
And now to summarize, in conclusion, on page 19, it was a solid start to the year, despite headwinds from working day patterns and continued low growth in mature economies.
The strategic focus on, and investments into, key growth markets of TDI and parcel continue to pay off.
We have an unchanged intensive focus on margin improvement and cash flow performance, and we're fully on track to deliver on our mid-term target for the Group; an EBIT of EUR3.35 billion to EUR3.55 billion in 2015.
So that's the end of my short presentation, and we would be happy to answer your questions.

Questions and Answers

Neil Glynn,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First of all, with respect to DHL Express, I notice material costs, which are comfortably the largest part of the Express cost base, continue to rise as a proportion of revenue.  Just interested, is this at all worrisome as you pursue your margin gains?  And can your increasing scale help you control material costs better?
Secondly, just a question on stamp price rises, and obviously implemented as of January 1.  Have you seen any noteworthy pushback in terms of volumes on that front yet?
And then finally, a few days ago there was an announcement with respect to the Postbus venture; just interested in the rationale for the venture and its expected benefit for Mail, or the broader Group.  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so the Express material cost line tends to jump around with fuel cost changes.  I would not read anything into that in terms of our ability to generate increased margins.  It also has to do with higher volumes, of course.
For the stamp prices and the volume effect, we have not seen a noticeable volume effect arising as a result of the stamp price increases.  That is what we suspected would happen.  But, of course, for the first price increase in 15 years we had to wait to see the actual evidence, and now we've seen in Q1 that probably the stamp price increases had very little impact on volumes.
So, yes, for the Postbus, we are working our way into that market in a joint venture with ADAC, the German automobile association.  Part of the rationale for it is that it's a network business, as is the postal business, and so it's one we're very familiar with.  We have a presence all over Germany and so get some potential synergies from ticket sale locations, for example.
So it's a market that is just really beginning due to a change in regulation, and one we think the good names of Deutsche Post and ADAC, together with their substantial capabilities in the German market, should give us a good chance to succeed.

Many thanks, Larry.

David Ross, Stifel.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus & Co. - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Could you talk a little bit about any volume impact that was seen in the first quarter in Mail from the strikes that were going on, and then maybe some details on the contract that was recently released -- or reached with Verdi?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, yes, there was actually very little volume impact from the strikes.  As opposed to a general strike, these strikes were so-called warning strikes which were done during the course of negotiations and actually affected only a very small percentage of the market, and was done in different cities or areas on different days and so volumes that might have been delayed by a day could be delivered on the next day.  So the volume impact was next to zero, I would say.
The contract that we've reached is one which runs from April 1, of this year through the end of June -- sorry, the end of May in 2015, so it's 26 months in total.  It provides a wage increase starting on August 1, of this year of 2.6%, and then another increase in October of next year of 3.1%, which extends then until the end of May of 2015.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus & Co. - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then, we're halfway through the second quarter, have you guys seen any improvements to the air freight markets?  Or are there other trends that you're seeing that give you confidence that GDP growth is going to accelerate from the 2% you saw in the first quarter to the 2.5% to 3% that you're keeping for the year?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the latter, we really haven't seen any evidence of that.  We have seen some quite encouraging data, especially coming out of Asia, from Shanghai, and Hong Kong, in the last couple of weeks on positive growth trends in air freight, though it's probably too early to draw any concrete conclusions as to whether that's going to be a trend, or not.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Ross,  Stifel Nicolaus & Co. - Analyst    [11]

Excellent.  Thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just two from me.  Just, firstly, a follow up on that -- on what you said on the Verdi deal.  Were there any productivity benefits, or any other benefits, to Deutsche Post agreed as part of that package?
And then secondly, parcel Germany, growing strongly.  Can you just remind us, what is your market share?  And as the market's been so strong, are you seeing more competitors starting to come into the market?  Thanks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, yes, on the Verdi agreement, there are not any productivity arrangements, or new arrangements, of note associated with this agreement.
Of course, we have the so-called generations agreement running through 2015, which does provide significant benefits in terms of managing especially the end of career for postal employees, and so those are in place.  But in terms of the new agreement, there are no additional arrangements or provisions of the agreement.
In terms of market share, we're just around 40% in total of the parcel market.  There's four other significant competitors, and we have not seen any new competitors of note entering the market.

Damian Brewer,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Got questions mainly focusing around the freight forwarding business, and in Express.  On Express, the TDI volumes appear to continue to do very well.  Could you bridge what the difference,  or what drove the much lower revenue growth, in the business was?   What are the other factors in there that's brought that volume growth down to a lower revenue growth, maybe excluding FX effects?
Then secondly, on the DHL forwarding business, it looks like the SG&A costs sitting between GP and EBIT fell 1% year on year.  What was driving that if the NFE costs were relatively flat?  And how can one think about the NFE spending, going forward?  Is there some seasonality to this?  And what causes it to pick up later?
Then, very finally, what's driving the accelerated GPP unit pressure in Q1?  Are there particular reasons, or mix effects, or customer effects behind that?  Is that anything to do with the new rail services out of China, for example, one out of Chengdu, in the mix?  Or is there something else in that?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I may need to ask you to come back and clarify the third question, I'm not sure I totally understood it, but maybe let's go to the first two.
The Express TDI volume growth was very strong.  We did have a slower revenue growth, and volume growth.  There's a couple of things you have to adjust for.  One is currency that you mentioned; the other is working days.  That certainly played a role for the Express business as well with Easter falling into March this year; that was at least two working days difference.
We also had the divestitures of the Australian and New Zealand domestic businesses, which we divested in the second quarter.  We still had them in the first quarter last year, so you have to adjust for that.
But all that being said, the difference between volume growth and revenue per day growth in TDI was around 2.4%.  That was primarily a mix effect, so a product or a sub-product and customer mix effect.  That's probably two-thirds of that 2.4%, and the remainder is what we think of as pricing realignment, or adjustments of pricing, where we're off-market.
I wouldn't categorize that the same way as price deterioration.  I would say it's just getting our prices more in line with competitive market situations.  So we're not dropping prices; on the contrary, we had the GRI implementation in the first quarter, which helped to keep the revenue decline relatively small.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The GP conversion overall for Global Forwarding continues to trend in a positive direction.  It was somewhat flattish in Q1, but overall we expect it to continue to improve over time, as it has improved certainly over the course of last year.
Maybe you could state again your third question, I'm not sure that I understood it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I was wondering about in the third question was the gross profit per unit that you generated in the both air and ocean business seems to have come under somewhat higher pressure than we've seen in the last, probably, two years.  I'm wondering what caused that.  Was it customer mix, pricing pressure, competitive pressure, or maybe a mix of product, for example, the rail services out of Asia?  Or is there something else going on there?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think it was probably all of the above, except for the last one.  The last one is something that we're just really starting up and really didn't have much impact in Q1.
There's been a significant amount of capacity taken out, in particular, in the air cargo sector.  On the other hand, the relatively soft market and the intense fight for volumes that led to a very slight deterioration in GP margins.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, understood.  And just coming back on second question, what I was trying to understand there was whether, particularly with the NFE costs, what's causing them to be what appears to be more seasonal through the year?  What meant they were flat year on year in Q1 but will build?  Is this just phasing of roll out, or is there something holding back the roll out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think it's not a seasonal effect; it's just much more a phasing effect where we anticipate in Q2 and Q3 rolling out the parts of the system that we have done to a significant number of countries.  That, of course, has expenses associated with it.  So I think it's more timing and phasing than anything else, and it's certainly not seasonality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, that's great.  Thank you very much.

Operator    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar, Nomura.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Nomura - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two questions, really.  Well, three questions, actually.  First of all, within the Mail business, were there any notable differences in the months within the quarter?  Did it start strong and finish weak, or vice versa?  Or was it a relatively stable performance across the three months?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, you also, as you look from month to month, have to consider the number of working days within the month.  But adjusted for that, we didn't really see any notable differences in the performance of the business from month to month.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Nomura - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, that's great.  Thank you.  Second question, obviously, we can see the CapEx in Q1, but you've also made the usual just north of EUR50 million of asset disposals.  What do you think the net CapEx is likely to come out at for the year if we took gross CapEx less asset disposals?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That one is hard to predict.  I think somewhere between EUR200 million to EUR300 million of disposals is as good of a range as I can give you.  Also coming into that figure are disposals of vehicles.  So we have huge fleets of vehicles all over the world, and when they have run their useful life for us then there's usually some value left and so a significant part of that is vehicles.
It's just hard to predict the exact timing, but if you use a range of EUR200 million to EUR300 million that's going to be a pretty good estimate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Nomura - Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, so it's normal asset turn, essentially, isn't it?  Then my final question is, obviously, you've guided the tax for 2013.  Can you give us any visibility, or do you have any visibility, beyond '13 on the tax rate?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There, of course, we won't have the benefit of the advantage that we had this year coming from the development of some tax audits that we have, and which leads us to believe that the tax rate can be 22% for the whole year.
On the other hand, as the business continues to improve in performance, in particular in the US, and to a lesser extent in Germany, there is always the possibility that we'll see what we saw in the last two years, and that's the activation of tax loss carry forwards.  We still have a significant amount of those that we have not yet activated, but could foreseeably activate some, which would help to keep our tax rate low.
In the absence of being able to do that, a good estimate for the tax rate after 2013 is in the 27% range.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark McVicar,  Nomura - Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, that's great.  Thank you very much.

Andy Chu,  Deutsche Bank Research - Analyst    [36]

Can I just ask two questions, please?  Firstly, on Mail, I guess you had the impact of two less working days.  And notwithstanding seasonality, I guess this was a pretty clean quarter Q1.  So, big picture, is there any reason why we can't think of actually annualizing the Q1 profitability of EUR382 million?
Big picture; I know obviously there's seasonality, and obviously you had a negative impact from the impact of working days, say EUR100 million.  But just in the context of your guidance, EUR1.1 billion to EUR1.2 billion, maybe you can remind if there's anything, or is there anything, later on in the year that might affect that big picture calculation?
And secondly, obviously a very strong free cash flow performance and I wondered if you might be able to help me square that away when we look at working capital and the big drive in improvement in working capital in Q1 versus previous expectations.
I think, Larry, you've had a slide in the past that's shown working capital slightly nudging up in terms of an arrow as the business grows.  But notwithstanding the growth in the business of the self-help initiatives that you can drive in terms of working capital improvement, so just in terms of that arrow, feels to me maybe more flattish than up.  But maybe I'm wrong in that respect.  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think the quality of Mail performance in Q1 is something we should continue to see throughout the year.  But, certainly, we would expect that there will be seasonality, in particular, Q3 tends to be the lowest seasonal quarter.  Because of vacation time in Germany, the parcel business tends to be a little lower in Q3.  And then Q4 tends to always be the strongest seasonal quarter --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The wage increase kicking in.  In August, we see the wage increase --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In terms of EBIT performance.  But in terms of top line, I would certainly expect again Q4 to be the strongest performer, and maybe Q3 slightly weaker.  But overall, the quality of the performance of the Mail business should be sustained throughout the year.  There's no reason that we have to think that it won't be.
In terms of working capital, I think a couple of things to remember; one is this effect from discontinuation of the factoring program we had last year. The overall improvement in working capital compared to Q1 last year was about EUR400 million, so about one-third of it was that discontinuation of the factoring program.  The other two-thirds I would attribute to good management really in all four divisions.
But also, you have to think about the trend from Q4 to Q1. Way back in Q4 of 2011, we had an extremely high cash inflow from working capital reduction and we had a bit of a bounce-back, or we had a big bounce back, in Q1 of last year.  This year, so the trend from Q4 2012, even though we had a good cash flow quarter in Q4 of last year, there wasn't such an extreme reduction and then bounce in Q1 of this year.  So that has a lot to do with it.
But also, I just think it is the very careful, intensive management of customer relationships, and the receivables we have from them, and also our payables management.

Just two questions from me, please.  Firstly, on Europe, can you just give us some idea why the TDI growth was so strong?  What is actually driving this?  Is it market share gains?  Or is it something else completely?  And is it Europe intercontinental outbound?  Or is it inbound into Europe?
And the second question is can you comment on the aim that I think you previously had for Express?  2013 was meant to be the year of margin expansion from increasing revenue quality rather than volume growth, and we seem to have still very, very high volume growth but the revenue quality looks to be lower.  And clearly you have lower advertising and promotional expenses as well, but we can't really see that much of an uptick in margins.  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, yes, Europe, we were very pleased with the around 11% volume growth per day that we had in Q1.  I think it's a clear indication that we're gaining share.  I think it's probably both inbound and outbound.  I think it has to do with overall quality of the global network that we have and the increases in customer service that we've implemented and invested in over the last year.
I just think Ken Allen and the team are just doing a great job on doing the execution of the Express business and the extremely good upgrade in service that we've been able to realize with our customers.
In terms of margin expansion, I don't know that revenue quality was the main driving factor in our assumption that we would be able to increase margins, as much as what I'll call operating leverage.  The Express business is a pretty high fixed cost content business and so, as you're able to continue to grow volumes and revenues, you should get a quite favorable impact on operating margins.
In our view, we're starting to see that already in Q1 of this year.  We had on a clean basis a 30 basis point increase over Q1 of last year, on a reported basis 70 basis points.  And so that is definitely a goal that we have for this year, for the Express management and the overall Company, to increase EBIT margins.  And the ultimate goal -- or at least maybe not the ultimate goal but the intermediate goal is to get over 10% by 2015, so two years from now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Julia Winarso,  HSBC Global Research - Analyst    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, can I just come back with another question?  If you have 10% volume growth, like you pretty much did in Q1, should that not translate into more than the 30 bps underlying increase in margins?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We had 10% TDI volume growth, but we also had a decline in the number of working days.  So the 10% was on a per day basis -- the 9.6% was on a per day basis, and it was actually a lower growth rate on a -- not corrected for the number of days.  It's the start of what we think is going to be a trend toward margin expansion.  And we're pleased that we've been able to make that progress already in Q1, and we expect to see that trend continue this year.

Larry, I just want to get back to follow up on some of the earlier questions about this bridge on the Express business, because I'm certainly struggling to make the ends meet slightly.
But you've got 2.4% organic revenue growth, so ex-FX and disposals, and you've obviously got this strong volume growth.  To what extent is that gap?  Can you actually put a percentage on to what extent that gap is explained by, specifically, the working day effect?  Is it 3% of that, or 4% of that?  And then at least we get a sense of what the negative price mix effect is.
Related to that, another question, also on Express.  You've obviously stopped disclosing the day definite domestic volumes.  I understand, obviously, they're not a big part of the overall revenues per day now, but I think they were still running at just less than 20% of total volumes.  In Q1, are those volumes -- I assume it's still there, you're just not showing them to us any more, is that the right way to think about it?  Or are they de minimis now?
And then my final question just again on the expenses within Express.  The biggest movement, obviously, was on the net other operating line, which was down EUR50 million in the quarter compared to Q1 last year.  Just wondering if you could comment on what goes in that line, and what the moving parts are there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The working day effect for Express, if you were doing a bridge, would be around 3%, or would have around the 3% effect on growth, so it is a significant effect for the quarter.  Again, it has to do with the Easter holiday falling in Q1, instead of Q2.
Yes, the day definite business, while it's still represents a fair amount of volume, represents what is approaching a quite small percentage of revenues, so mid single-digits, there's a couple of still quite important businesses that we intend to keep; notably, Blue Dart in India, and also the Mexico day definite business.
But most of the other businesses have now been divested.  And it's one that we de-emphasize because TDI is the core business, and that represents close to 70% of the revenues.
So, yes, net other operating, one of the things that explains the trend is the gain that we had on the Romanian divestiture, so the EUR12 million gain.  If you look over the trend by quarter, yes, it was high in Q1 of last year.  But it moves around a bit.  There's a bit of variability from quarter to quarter.  It's really a number of smaller operating items so I really wouldn't read much into it besides the one effect that we talked about for Romania.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joel Spungin,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thanks for that, Larry.  Just one quick follow up.  If you had shown us the day definite domestic volume number, would it have been negative?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, not least because we've done those divestitures from last year.  So it would have been significantly negative.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Joel Spungin,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great.  Thank you very much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just had a follow up on Express, from Julia's question, maybe asked slightly differently.  If we look at the incremental revenue organically, it looks about EUR70 million.  Granted you had the headwind from day counts, but that converting into EUR10 million of EBIT, obviously, there's some other headwinds.  How should we think about the natural conversion of Express over time?  Or what would you expect over the medium term from incremental volume-related revenue growth?  That would be the first question.
Second, with respect to day count, you specified an expectation for Q2 and Q3 some offsetting benefit for the Mail division.  Would you expect the same for Express?
Lastly, about 25% of the revenue base in Express is unaccounted for if we look at the TDI/TDD volumes.  How should we think about the profitability of those other operations, and their contribution in the quarter?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let's maybe come to the day count question.  There, the fact that we don't have Easter falling into Q2 certainly should mean that there is a day count benefit in Q2.
Yes, the 25% of the remaining revenue base is the day definite domestic; it's also the so-called ASC business, so non-express business, that we are doing opportunistically to improve capacity utilization on our flights.  Those are, probably, the two biggest factors in the items that we don't separately identify.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The other question was whether there is a incremental marginal which we would encourage people to assume.  I think, no.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think that's a hard one to really quantify, so I really wouldn't want to give an estimate on that.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Combe,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay.  One last one on NFE.  As you start -- from what you've commented on the last few quarters, it suggests that everything is on track and you're starting to see some positive traction.  At which point do you start to think about applications for the road freight division?  And what could that mean?  And what would the timing look like?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actually, there's no intention generally to implement NFE for the road freight business; it is, at the current time, intended to implement just for the forwarding business.
And, yes, we are very much on track with NFE, and pleased about the progress.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Combe,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [60]

Thank you, just one quick follow up on supply chain.  Clearly, it was a record quarter in terms of new business wins, and I see tech contributed 36% of those new business wins, which certainly, in recent history, is a record for tech's contribution.  What is going on in terms of why tech was so strong in that first quarter?  And does that help you in terms of your confidence with the rest of the year for supply chain?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think the sector is important.  We had a really good and large contract signed with Panasonic during the quarter that accounted for much of that increase and --

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Martin Ziegenbalg,  Deutsche Post AG - Head of IR    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think it's worth keeping in mind that in supply chain you've got a very long run up time before you actually sign a contract, so we're talking about a number of quarters.  So it's not that we had a high number of walk-ins in Q1 from the tech sector.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right.  And while our service in each of the sectors is critically important, the timing of when you get a new contract in individual sectors can be somewhat unpredictable.  And this quarter we just did great in the tech sector, mainly due to that one pretty big contract that we signed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Combe,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So just to round back on the Panasonic deal, that's more a function of things you've been continuing to develop, rather than, let's say, leveraging new competencies?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I certainly think we're going to bring all of our best competencies to that contract.  I think what Martin was trying to say is it's one that's been in discussion for quite some time, for a number of quarters.  Because those contracts are important to us and to our customers and are relatively long term in nature, we usually take some time to negotiate them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Combe,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [68]

That's great, thank you.

I have just a few questions on the Mail side.  Can you be a bit more specific on the effect of the Infobrief switch?
Secondly, can you share with us what your feelings are for the volume development in domestic letter mail, full year?
You mentioned the intermediate margin target for Express of 10%.  Can you also share with us the targets that you have for the other two DHL divisions?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Infobrief switch, or the reclassification of the products that we used to call Infobrief now to mail communication and no more to dialog marketing, tended to make their growth in mail communication higher and dialog marketing lower, in each case by between 1% and 2%.  So, yes, that's been the effect of that switch.
In terms of volume development for letter for the full year, not revenue development but volume -- not revenue but volume development, we would expect to be pretty much on our long-term trend rate of around minus 3%.
EBIT targets for the Supply Chain business and for the Global Forwarding, Freight business I would not want to name.  But I will tell you that as we are projecting in Express to grow EBIT from the 2010 underlying level by 13% to 15% on a compound average rate until 2015, we expect to do that in Supply Chain, and also in Global Forwarding, Freight.
So it's harder to make an assumption about what revenue levels are going to be.  In particular, in Global Forwarding it's highly dependent on fuel prices, for example; and so it's dependent on fuel prices, too, for Express.  But we don't, and haven't, named specific targets for the other two DHL businesses, but certainly, if we achieve our goal of growing EBIT with compound average growth of 13% to 15%, we would expect margins to increase as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, just one follow-on question, if I can, please, which is on the Mail business.  Could you tell us a little bit what lay behind the staff costs development in Mail, up 2.8%, but against a substantially higher wage settlement in its final quarter?  What bridged the gap?  Was that still the mix of the employee base, or was there anything else in there?  Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mail business in Q1 had a 4% difference in wage costs compared to Q1 of 2012, and that has to do with the last wage agreement, which was a 15-month agreement.  It started on January 1, of last year, but the 4% increase kicked in on April 1, of last year.  So that meant that, other things being equal, wage costs this year were 4% higher than last year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Damian Brewer,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm just thinking, because you had a 0.4% growth in the average FTEs in your quarter as well, so somewhere there's a 1.5%/2% efficiency effect in the business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Rosen,  Deutsche Post AG - CFO    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes.  We've been doing a good job, in particular, of managing overhead costs, and have also managed well the balance between outsourced and permanent employees.  We also have attrition in the business.  So, yes, we've been able to do a great job managing costs in the Mail business, including personnel cost.

Damian Brewer,  RBC Capital Markets - Analyst    [78]
