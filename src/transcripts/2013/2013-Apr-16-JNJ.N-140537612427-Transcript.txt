Good morning, and welcome to the Johnson & Johnson's first-quarter 2013 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. 
(Operator Instructions) 
I would now like to turn the conference over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the first quarter of 2013. Joining me on the call today is Dominic Caruso, Vice President - Finance and Chief Financial Officer. 
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available to a broader audience via a Webcast, accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. I'll begin by briefly reviewing highlights of the first quarter for the Corporation, and highlights for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the financial results and guidance for 2013. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately one hour. Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses, to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release. 
Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review may be considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2012 identifies certain factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, or future events or developments. The 10-K is available through the Company, or online. During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release, and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at www.investor.JNJ.com. 
Now I would like to review the results for the first quarter of 2013. If you would refer to your copy of the press release, let's begin with the schedule titled Supplementary Sales Data by Geographic Area. Worldwide sales to customers were $17.5 billion for the first quarter of 2013, up 8.5% as compared to the first quarter of 2012. On an operational basis, sales were up 9.8%, and currency had a negative impact of 1.3%. The acquisition of Synthes was completed in the second quarter of 2012. In the current quarter, the acquisition, net of the impact of the divestiture of the legacy DePuy trauma business, contributed 5.7% to the worldwide operational sales growth. In the US, sales were up 11.2%. In regions outside the US, our operational growth was 8.7%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 2.4 points. The Asia-Pacific Africa region grew 11.8% operationally, while the Western Hemisphere, excluding the US, grew by 9.1% operationally. Europe grew 6.2% on an operational basis. The success of new product launches and Synthes sales made strong contributions to the results in all regions. 
If you'll now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings. Net earnings were $3.5 billion, compared to $3.9 billion in the same period in 2012. Earnings per share were $1.22, versus $1.41 a year ago. Please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule, where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items. As a reference in the accompanying table on non-GAAP measures, 2013 first-quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude special items, primarily related to an increase in the litigation accrual, as well as integration and transaction costs related to the acquisition of Synthes, Inc.  First-quarter 2012 net earnings included a gain related to an after-tax special item of $106 million, as outlined in the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Excluding these special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $4.1 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $1.44, representing increases of 8% and 5.1%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2012. 
I would you now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to earnings, before we move on to the segment highlights. For the first quarter of 2013, cost of goods sold at 31.7% was up 130 basis points from the same period last year, primarily due to an inventory step-up charge related to the Synthes acquisition. Excluding the inventory step-up charge, which has been treated as a special item, cost of goods sold increased 50 basis points versus the same period last year. Incremental amortization expense related to Synthes of approximately $140 million negatively impacted cost of goods sold by 80 basis points. Also impacting cost of goods sold were the ongoing remediation work in our OTC business, and the medical devices excise tax. Positive mix and cost reduction efforts partially offset these items. 
First-quarter selling, marketing and administrative expenses, at 29.8% of sales, were down 130 basis points, due to timing of expenditures, as well as cost containment initiatives across many of our businesses. Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 10.2%, consistent with our 2012 results. Interest expense net of interest income of $104 million, was down $26 million versus the first quarter of 2012, due to a lower average debt level. Other expense net of other income was $515 million in the first quarter of 2013, compared to $611 million of other income net of other expense in the same period last year. Excluding special items, other income net of other expense of $83 million was $411 million less than 2012, due primarily to lower gains on divestitures. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate of 19% in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 22.8% in the same period last year. Dominic will provide commentary on taxes in his remarks. 
Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule, highlighting key products or businesses for the first quarter of 2013. I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales for the first quarter of 2013 of $3.7 billion increased 2.2% as compared to the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 3.3%, while the impact of currency was negative 1.1%. US sales were up 2.4%, while international sales grew 3.8% on an operational basis. 
Excluding the impact of divestitures net of acquisitions, operational growth was approximately 4.3%. Baby care products increased on an operational basis by 7%, when compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to wipes, hair care, cleansers and powders. Sales in the oral care business increased 5.1% operationally. Results were driven by strong sales of Listerine, due to the continued success of new product launches, partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of the manual toothbrushes in the US. 
For the first quarter of 2013, sales for OTC Pharmaceuticals and Nutritionals increased 7.6% on an operational basis, compared to the same period in 2012, with US sales up 14.4%, and sales outside the US up 3.9% on an operational basis. The strong sales results in the US were driven by analgesics and upper respiratory products, due to progress in returning a reliable supply of products to the marketplace and a strong flu season. Strong growth of analgesics drove results outside the US. Our Skincare business was flat on an operational basis in the first quarter of 2013. Strong results for Neutrogena were offset by the impact of divestitures, the initial stocking related to new product launches last year, and competitive pressures. Women's health grew 0.8% on an operational basis due to strong growth in liners, offset by lower sales of KY products. Wound Care/Other sales decreased 10% on an operational basis, with a sales decline in the US of 13.3% and outside the US, operational sales were down 6.1%, due to competitive pressures and the impact of divestitures. 
That completes our review of the consumer segment, and I'll now review highlights for our Pharmaceutical segment. Worldwide net sales for the first quarter of $6.8 billion increased 10.4% versus the same period last year. On an operational basis, sales increased 11.4%, with a negative currency impact of 1 point. Sales in the US increased 14.7%, while sales outside the US increased on an operational basis by 8.1%. US results included a positive adjustment to previous estimates for managed Medicaid rebates under the Affordable Care Act, related to new data received from the states. Excluding this item, both US sales and worldwide sales were up approximately 8% operationally. The most significant impacts from the adjustment were in immunology, neuroscience and PROCRIT. 
Now reviewing sales for major therapeutic areas. Immunology products grew 16.8% operationally, with sales in the US up 12.8%. Excluding the adjustment, US immunology growth was approximately 6.5%, with REMICADE, excluding export sales, up approximately 4%, SIMPONI up approximately 22%, and STELARA up approximately 57%. Results were driven by strong market growth across the major products, complemented by increased market share for STELARA. With the strength of our portfolio, we continue to be the US market leader in immunology. REMICADE export sales declined 7.7%, due primarily to a change in inventory levels. 
Immunology sales outside the US increased by 30.1% operationally, due to strong results for both SIMPONI and STELARA. SIMPONI's strong growth was due to the increased shipments to our distribution partner, and very strong growth in Japan. STELARA made significant contributions, due primarily to market share gains complemented by strong market growth in the major regions. Sales of infectious disease products increased 8.6% on an operational basis. INCIVO, a treatment for Hepatitis C, grew 24.9% on an operational basis, due to the success of the continued roll-out, primarily in Latin America. Please note for your models, 2012 sales by quarter for both INCIVO and XARELTO have been included in the sales by major product schedule. Continued momentum and market share growth of PREZISTA made notable contributions to the results, as did the combined sales of [COMPLARENT] and EDURANT. 
Neuroscience product sales increased 7.7% on an operational basis, with US growth at 10.7%. Excluding the managed Medicaid adjustment, which is primarily related to TOPAMAX and CONCERTA, US sales declined approximately 2%, impacted by generic competition, primarily for CONCERTA and DURAGESIC. The long-acting injectable anti-psychotics, RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA, or XEPLION, achieved operational growth of nearly 20%, due to an increased in combined market share. INVEGA achieved double-digit operational growth of 11.1%, due to strong operational growth outside the US, primarily driven by increased market share in Japan. 
Sales of oncology products increased 35% on an operational basis, due to the very strong results for ZYTIGA. ZYTIGA is now approved to treat both chemo-refractory and chemo-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In the quarter, ZYTIGA achieved operational sales growth of over 70%, with US sales growing 61%, due to very strong market growth of over 20%, and increased market share in the combined metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer market. ZYTIGA has captured 28% of that market, and is up 1.5 points sequentially. Operational sales outside the US grew 83.4% versus first quarter 2012, and on a sequential basis, were up over 20%. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 75 countries. 
VELCADE is a treatment for multiple myeloma. Sales increased 2.5% on an operational basis. As I mentioned last quarter, timing of tender business negatively impacted the growth rate in the first quarter of 2013. Excluding the timing of the tender business, operational growth was over 20%. Strong performance in patient share in the front line setting and the launch of the subcutaneous version continues to drive sales growth.  
Other oncology increased, primarily due to DOXIL/CAELYX. Regarding DOXIL in the US, Janssen is releasing additional DOXIL produced by an alternate manufacturing approach under the regulatory discretion of the US FDA. The longer term solution for DOXIL/CAELYX production, involving transitioning manufacturing to additional suppliers, continues to meet expected milestones. Other Pharmaceutical products declined 1.7% on an operational basis, with lower sales for EPREX and PARIET related primarily to generic competition. PROCRIT results were impacted by the managed Medicaid adjustment. Excluding this item, PROCRIT sales declined approximately 14%, due primarily to a market decline. 
Positively impacting results, XARELTO sales grew over 60% on a sequential basis, capturing 38% of the new-to-brand scripts in cardiology. Total prescription share in the broader anti-coagulant market grew 1.6 points on a sequential basis, to 5.6%. As an update on the status of the acute coronary syndrome indication for XARELTO, the FDA issued a second complete response letter. Janssen is continuing to work with the FDA to address their questions. That completes the review of the Pharmaceutical segment. 
I'll now review the medical devices and diagnostics segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment sales of $7.1 billion grew 11.9% operationally, as compared to the same period in 2012. Currency had a negative impact of 1.7 points, resulting in a total sales increase of 10.2%. Sales excluding the net impact of Synthes were down 2.4% on an operational basis, with US sales down 5.2%, and sales outside the US down 0.2% on an operational basis. Divestitures and exits from certain businesses drove approximately half the worldwide operational decline in the quarter. Market dynamics, including lower distributor inventories, pricing pressures, as well as the impact of less selling days, particularly in our orthopedics business, negatively impacted operational growth by approximately 2 points. I will provide more commentary on these factors in the franchise reviews. 
Now turning to the MD&D businesses, starting with cardiovascular care. Cardiovascular care sales were up 8.5% operationally, with US up 12.5%, and sales outside the US up 6.2% operationally. Excluding the impact of drug eluting stents, worldwide sales were up nearly 11% on an operational basis, due to strong results for Biosense Webster and endovascular products. Biosense Webster, our electrophysiology business, achieved worldwide operational sales growth of nearly 12% in the quarter, driven by market share growth. The expansion of the installed base of the CARTO 3 system, and the success of catheter launches made strong contributions to the results. Strong double-digit growth for endovascular products were driven by the relaunch of the S.M.A.R.T. vascular stent systems, and the EXOSEAL vascular closure device. 
The diabetes care business operational sales declined 9.8% in the first quarter of 2013, with US business down 19.6%, due to the impact of the initial stocking related to new product launches last year, lower price, and competitive pressures, including private label. The business outside the US grew 0.9% operationally, with strong sales in emerging markets largely offset by lower sales in many of the developed markets. The diagnostics business declined 4.9% on an operational basis. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of RhoGAM and the Therakos business, operational sales grew approximately 2%, with US growth of approximately 8% and growth outside the US down approximately 3% operationally. Results in the US were driven by strong growth in clinical labs and donor screening. 
Infection prevention declined 10.5% on an operational basis, with sales in the US down 26.7%. Last year in the US, a customer program to upgrade systems to STERRAD solutions ended in the first quarter, impacting the timing of capital purchases for the balance of the year in 2012. Excluding capital sales, US results declined approximately 3.5% in the quarter, due primarily to timing of purchases for consumables. Outside the US, operational growth of 4.1% was driven by both consumables and capital item sales. 
Orthopaedic sales were up 60.7% on an operational basis, when compared to the same period in 2012. Excluding the net impact of Synthes, and the divestiture of certain neurosurgical instruments, operational sales were flat, with the US flat, and outside the US down approximately 1% operationally. Worldwide sales were impacted by approximately 1.5 less selling days in the quarter. Operationally, hips were up 2% worldwide, driven by 5% growth in the US, due to strong results in primary stem platform sales, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Hips outside the US were flat on an operational basis, with strong results in the emerging markets, offset by slower sales in the developed markets. Knees worldwide climbed 1% on an operational basis, with US up 1%, driven by fixed bearing and revision platforms, offset by lower sales of rotating platforms. 
Sales outside the US were down 2%, with lower sales of low contact stress, or LCS, and mobile bearing technology. Including the Synthes business in both periods, and excluding the divested DePuy trauma business in both periods, trauma grew approximately 2% on an operational basis, with similar results both in and outside the US. The fourth-quarter supply disruption in the US was substantially remedied late in the first quarter. Including the Synthes business in both periods, worldwide spine was down 7% on an operational basis, with the US down approximately 10%, impacted by the continued softness in the market, as well as the restructuring of the commercial sales organization. Outside the US, sales were down approximately 3% operationally. 
Specialty Surgery operational growth was 1% in the first quarter of 2013. US sales were down 2.4%, and sales outside the US were up 4.7% on an operational basis. Strong sales of energy products outside the US and solid results for biosurgical products were substantially offset by lower sales of Mentor products due to market and pricing pressures. Surgical care worldwide sales were down 5.4% on an operational basis, with the US down 10.5%, and sales outside the US down 2.4% operationally. 
Negatively impacting growth were divestitures and business exits, as well as other factors such as reduction in inventory levels. Excluding these items, the underlying business was down approximately 1.5 points. Competitive and pricing dynamics impacted sales in the quarter. Rounding out the review of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment, our Vision Care business achieved operational sales growth of 1.6% in the first quarter, compared to the same period last year, with similar results both in and outside the US. Growth was driven by daily lenses and astigmatism lenses, partially offset by lower sales of reusable lenses. 
That completes highlights for the medical Devices and Diagnostics segment and concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter of 2013. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic?

Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Louise, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by saying that our thoughts and prayers are with the families and victims of the tragic event in Boston yesterday. Now, turning to the business of this call. I'd like to provide some additional comments about our first-quarter results, highlight some of our recent business and pipeline developments, and then provide our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2013. I am pleased to say that we're off to a good start in 2013 with solid results in the first quarter. We continued delivering on our three near-term priorities, building the momentum in our pharmaceuticals business, integrating Synthes, and returning a reliable supply of OTC products to the marketplace. 
I'd like to make a few comments on the state of the healthcare market. While we believe that overall healthcare utilization trends continue to show signs of stabilization, the modest positive increases we saw in the fourth quarter do not appear the to have persisted, and at this point, we are not anticipating a meaningful market acceleration this year. Adapting to these changes in the healthcare environment is important, and our leaders continue to apply financial discipline to our operations, while investing in key growth opportunities. 
Our growth strategies of creating value through innovation, global reach with a local focus, excellence in execution and leading with a purpose are being executed well across our businesses, as you will see in the review of our highlights for the first quarter. The breadth of our business, which provides balance and consistency to our overall performance, as well as the extraordinary achievements and dedication of our people in all of our locations around the world, positions us well to sustain and drive growth in this increasingly dynamic global healthcare market. 
Let's review some highlights of the Q1 results. We had a solid start to the year, and are pleased to report earnings per share of $1.44, excluding special items. This result was driven by operational sales growth in the first quarter of 9.8% versus the prior year, which was led by the success of many of our recently-launched Pharmaceutical products, as well as the addition of Synthes to our orthopaedics business. 
As we announced in February, our first-quarter earnings were impacted by the Venezuelan government's decision to devalue its currency, for which we incurred a charge of approximately $100 million to net income, and which resulted in a $0.04 negative impact to earnings per share. This charge is related to the remeasurement of our local balance sheet at the date of the devaluation. We did not treat this charge as a special item, and I am pleased that this negative impact to earnings was more than offset by strong operating performance in the first quarter. 
As you know, the federal R&D tax credit was renewed by Congress in January, under the American Taxpayer Relief Act for both 2012 and 2013, and during the first quarter, we recorded the full-year impact of the 2012 effect. We recorded special items in the first quarter of approximately $600 million on an after-tax basis, that consisted of charges primarily for litigation expense accruals related to various legal matters, and as expected, continued costs associated with the global integration of Synthes. Along with the charge for in-process research and development, these special items negatively impacted our first-quarter results by $0.22 per share. Excluding these special items, our adjusted earnings per share of $1.44 for the quarter exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates of $1.40, as published by FirstCall. 
Let's look at sales performance by segment. In Pharmaceuticals, we reported operational sales growth in the quarter of approximately 11.4%, fueled by the continued strong performance of long-established brands including REMICADE, PREZISTA, STELARA, and INVEGA SUSTENNA, and more recently-launched products, such as ZYTIGA and XARELTO,  which are continuing to grow share, even with new competitors entering their markets, largely due to the strength of the clinical profiles of these medicines themselves, and the strong commercialization capabilities in our Pharmaceuticals business. 
In MD&D, sales increased 11.9% operationally versus the prior year. This included the impact of Synthes, net of the divestiture of the DePuy trauma business, which contributed 14% of growth. In addition to Synthes, Biosense Webster's electrophysiology devices, and Cordis's endovascular products in our cardiovascular care business, coupled with Vision Care's ACUVUE TruEye and 1-DAY ACUVUE Moist Disposable Lens also contributed to our growth. Strategic divestitures and exits from certain businesses have impacted the growth in our MD&D segment this quarter, as did key market dynamics such as the initial implementation of the Medicare competitive bidding legislation in diabetes, significant decreases in the women's health market, and reductions in US distributor inventory levels, as well as less selling days, particularly in orthopaedics, as Louise mentioned. 
In our Consumer business, of particular note this quarter is the growth in our over-the-counter medicines businesses, as we continued to make progress in returning a reliable supply of high-quality products to consumers. In the quarter we saw operational sales increase of 3.3%, driven by the positive contribution of Tylenol and Motrin analgesics, upper respiratory over-the-counter medications, baby care products, Listerine mouthwash and our Neutrogena skincare products. Divestitures impacted the growth in this segment by 1%. 
I'd like to provide an update on exciting developments in our pipeline of new products, and I'll start with developments in our Pharmaceutical business. We were extremely pleased to have received FDA approval for INVOKANA, the first in a new class of SGLT2 inhibitors for Type 2 diabetes to be available in the United States. It's also the first Pharmaceutical product for Johnson & Johnson in this category, and will be a core component of our comprehensive platform for the management of diabetes. As such, our diabetes care business will partner with our Pharmaceuticals business to directly sell INVOKANA to healthcare professionals treating patients with diabetes. We're also expecting a decision from the European Medicines Agency on our application for INVOKANA later this year, and in order to expand its use, in March we submitted a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency, seeking approval for a fixed dose therapy that combines INVOKANA and immediate release Metformin. You will recall that we filed an application for this combination with the FDA in December. 
In the quarter, simeprevir, or TMC435, was filed for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C in both Japan and the US, and an EU filing is expected in the second quarter. In addition, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designations for the investigational oral agent ibrutinib, as a monotherapy for three B-cell malignancies. We continue to anticipate filings for the mantle cell lymphoma indication by the end of the year. This designation is intended to expedite the development and review time for potential new medicine that treats serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions based on preliminary clinical evidence. 
Turning to our MD&D businesses, Ethicon Endo-Surgery earned 510(K) clearances from the US FDA for two products, in the ENSEAL G2 line, the Cordless Tissue Sealer, a first of its kind product that includes a power generator, and the ENSEAL G2 Articulating Tissue Sealer Device, which makes it easier for surgeons to seal some vessels and control bleeding. Supporting our strategy to further our position in the endovascular market, Cordis completed its acquisition of Flexible Stenting Solutions, a leading developer of innovative flexible peripheral arterial, venous and biliary stents. And recently, our diabetes care business submitted a pre-market approval application to the FDA for the Animas Vibe insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring system. This next-generation insulin pump incorporates Animus's color screen and waterproof technology, and the Dexcom G4 Platinum Sensor, which enables people with diabetes to make more informed decisions to help control their disease. 
In our Consumer business, during the quarter, Johnson & Johnson China Investment completed the acquisition of Shanghai Elsker Mother & Baby Co., Ltd., a well-regarded baby care company in China, known for its position in the natural segment. This line with our growth strategy of driving global growth with products intended for use in specific local markets. Our ability to continue to advance our pipeline for new products in all three of our segments supports our confidence in the continued growth of our business. Now, let me provide some guidance for you to consider, as you refine your models for 2013. 
Let me begin with a discussion of cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $6 billion of net cash. This consists of approximately $22 billion of cash and marketable securities, and $16 billion of debt. For purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense between $450 million and $500 million, consistent with our previous guidance. 
Turning to other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, and other divestiture asset sales or write-offs. This account also includes the impact of the Venezuelan government's decision to devalue its currency. This account is difficult to forecast, but we would be comfortable with your models for 2013 reflecting other income and expense as a net gain, excluding special items, ranging from approximately $750 million to $850 million, which is consistent with our previous guidance. And now, a word on taxes. The first quarter reflects the full-year impact of the 2012 R&D tax credit, and for the first quarter of 2013, the Company's effective tax rate, excluding special items, was 19%. We suggest that you model our effective tax rate for the full year 2013 at approximately 20%, consistent with our previous guidance. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve upon this rate during the remainder of the year. 
Now, turning to sales and earnings. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of between approximately 5.7% and 6.7% for the year, which is higher than our previous guidance. This would result in estimated sales for 2013 on a constant currency basis of approximately $71.1 billion to $71.7 billion. While we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact if currency exchange rates for the remainder of 2013 were to stay where they were as of last week, as an example, with the euro at approximately $1.31, then our sales growth rate would be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for the year. Thus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales growth to be between approximately 4.7% and 5.7% for the year, for an expected level of reported sales of approximately between $70.4 billion and $71.1 billion, which is lower than our prior guidance, due exclusively to the weakening of several currency exchange rates versus the US dollar. 
Turning to earnings. As a reminder, our guidance reflects the following major assumptions. The implementation of the medical device excise tax. This has an incremental negative impact to earnings per share of approximately $0.05, and is recorded in cost of goods sold throughout the year. We will have a full-year impact of amortization related to Synthes of approximately $550 million on a pretax basis, or an incremental half-year negative impact to earnings per share of approximately $0.06. Our estimated 2013 earnings include total amortization expense for the enterprise of approximately $1.4 billion on a pretax basis. 
Considering these factors that I just noted, as well as the early strength we saw in our operating results for the first quarter, we suggest you consider full-year 2013 EPS estimates, excluding the impact of special items, of between $5.33 and $5.43 per share on an operational basis, or a growth rate of between 4.5% and 6.5% on a constant currency basis, which is higher than our previous guidance. We are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on earnings per share, if currency exchange rates for all of 2013 were to remain where they were at the end of last week, then our reported EPS, excluding special items, would be positively impacted by approximately $0.02 per share or $0.03 lower than the $0.05 positive impact we had previously estimated in our guidance, due to exchange rate fluctuations. We therefore suggest that you model our reported earnings per share, excluding special items, in the range between $5.35 and $5.45 per share, or a growth rate of between 5% and 7%, resulting in our reported EPS guidance being consistent with our previous reported EPS guidance, reflecting some stronger operational earnings, offset by the negative impact of weaker currency exchange rates. 
Overall, as you update your models for the guidance I just provided, you should see that pretax operating profits are expected to improve at a slightly better rate than we had previously contemplated when we provided guidance back in January. Now Louise, back to you for the question-and-answer session.

Your first question is from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Dodds,  Citigroup - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Couple quick questions. First, on the managed Medicaid, how far back does that accrual go, and why in Q1, because you didn't highlight it in the fourth-quarter call. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, Matt. Good question. The Affordable Care Act was instituted in 2010, in March of 2010, and it's only recently in the first quarter that we received sufficient information from the various states to true-up the estimates we had made leading from the time that legislation was passed until now. So hopefully that answers your question. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Dodds,  Citigroup - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It does, and then one more quick one for you, Dominic. On foreign exchange, it's now up to negative 100 basis points in the top line, but it's positive $0.02 in the bottom. That usually doesn't work that way with you. How come it's a positive on the earnings this time? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. Well, the major swing in currencies, Matt, that are negatively impacting sales are primarily currencies where although there may be significant sales growth, there's lesser earnings impact. For example, the yen is dramatically weakened. However, the amount of money we earn in that currency is different than the level of sales in that currency. Whereas the Euro, which is where most of the profitability of the Company resides, ex-US, has not been impacted as greatly as some of the other currencies like the yen. So there's a different weighting factor of the currency's impact on sales, as there is on earnings. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Dodds,  Citigroup - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, Dominic.

Your next question is from Larry Biegelsen, with Wells Fargo.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Biegelsen,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic, could you just help us with the outlook on the diabetes blood glucose monitoring business? Just the Medicare cuts start I think in July 2013, so I assume the US growth will probably get worse before it gets better. Maybe if you could just help us with some metrics to understand how to forecast that business, given what's going on there, and maybe a little bit about your strategy to address these issues. And I had one follow-up. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, Larry. Great question. As I know you've all been following, the recent legislation provides a pretty dramatic reduction in pricing for diabetes test strips. Of course, that legislation pertains to the Medicare portion of the business. I think roughly the Medicare portion of the business for us is in the 20% to 25% range, so it's not obviously the entire business. Then in terms of the strategy going forward, of course we just -- I just described earlier that we were pleased to have filed the new application for a new blood glucose monitoring system, a continuous glucose monitoring system with the Dexcom technology, so I think it's important that we continue to innovate where we have the ability to provide patients and healthcare professionals with the tools to better manage their diabetes care. I think that will always be an important part of what we continue to do, although we'll have to manage through the pricing impacts that pertain to the Medicare portion of our business, as I just noted. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Biegelsen,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Dominic. And then one more for you. More and more of your peers are excluding amortization from non-GAAP earnings. You mentioned, I think $1.4 billion. By our math, that potentially reduces your stock price by about $6. Do you think that impacts your valuation? Is that something that you may be willing to revisit in the future, excluding it from your non-GAAP earnings? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right. Larry, so we're certainly aware of that. I think that if it was just as easy -- if was that easy for me to just change our earnings by excluding amortization, and our stock would go up $6, we would do that in a heartbeat. I think our Company is very well followed, understood, and we try to be as transparent as possible if our earnings guidance, and hopefully the data we give you provides you all enough data to model the Company appropriately. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Larry Biegelsen,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC - Analyst    [12]

Your next question is from Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Weinstein,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One piece of guidance that surprised me, Dominic, was what Matt was touching on, which is the FX swing. So you add 130 basis point swing on the top line, versus your initial guidance in the fourth quarter, but that's only a  $0.03 impact to your EPS guidance for the year. Is that -- that's purely just because the differentials in profits, or us does that relate more to either your transfer pricing, or some hedges you may have there that we're just not aware of? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, it's primarily related to the reasons I mentioned. Currencies like the yen have dramatically decreased, but currency like the Euro, for example, is only off $0.02 or $0.03 from our previous guidance. Most of our ex-US earnings are quite frankly in the Euro zone so the impact to earnings is not as pronounced as the overall basket of currency would indicate. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Weinstein,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to focus on some of your commentary around utilization and your medical device end markets. Obviously I understood you were trying to signal that you don't see a pick-up in some of your device end markets, and you also made comments though, about your kind of the competitive positioning in a couple of them. So maybe you could spend a minute more maybe on both, and I want to maybe focus on two areas. One is general surgery, and the second is orthopedics. So, can you just give us more of a sense of both how you're feeling about those end markets, and competitively, particularly on the general surgery side, where you may be seeing some impact? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, Mike. Well, with respect to utilization, we're trying to follow what's happening in the marketplace. Obviously, we have a good vantage point from where we stand, with a broad-based business that we have. But we did not see any meaningful continuation of the upswing that we saw, though it was modest, in the fourth quarter. We didn't see that persist into the first quarter, and we also know that certain hospitals are already predicting lower levels of procedure volume than they had previously indicated. We just you saw something this morning from HCA for example, that talked about the level of procedure volume that they see, which is quite frankly, lower than the level they had predicted when they announced their guidance for 2013. 
So overall, I think that the market is probably seeing some seasonality, quite frankly. So if I comment on orthopedics first, we did in fact see an uptick in the orthopedics market overall, and we did particularly well in the fourth quarter. We did not see that persist in the first quarter of 2013, although there is some noise there, of course, because then you have less selling days, as Louise pointed out. So if you neutralize for that, it's about equal in terms of the overall impact to our business first quarter versus fourth quarter. So no great acceleration, but no deceleration, per se, in orthopedics. Just really the selling days impact, is what is dramatically impacting that business. 
For surgery, there's a number of factors that we mentioned. For example, lowering levels of inventory by distributors, some pricing impact, and we did see some competitive in-roads in general surgery, and obviously our response to that is to continue to improve, with the offering of products that we have, like the ENSEAL products that I just described were recently produced. So I'd say more competitive pressures in surgery, less so in orthopedics, if you were distinguishing those two particular markets. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael Weinstein,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. - Analyst    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Thank you.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your next question is from Kristin Stewart, Deutsche Bank. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kristen Stewart,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just going back to the guidance, and I guess increasing the constant currency sales guidance, I just want to be clear on what kind of gives you the comfort that you can kind of raise it this stage of the year, especially given what you just described as being generally weak within the medical device business and it sounds like your expectations for utilization in that category are more moderate, relative to what you saw entering the year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, Kristen. So it's a good observation, obviously, but as you know, we have a broad-based business. So even though we may see some weakness in the MD&D market, we're very pleased with the launch of the products in the Pharmaceutical market. We did have the adjustment that Louise described, which was obviously positive for the quarter, and positive for the year. And our consumer business is off to a very good start as well, and we expect that to pick up as products continue to come into the marketplace, from the products that were previously off the market. So overall, the breadth of our business allows us to feel comfortable, and although some areas of the business, we may experience some market weaknesses, other areas of the business are more than picking up, so that gives us good confidence to lean forward, in terms of how our business is doing for the balance of 2013. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kristen Stewart,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then any update on the diagnostic business, just in terms of your thinking on that franchise, whether it's a spin-off or selling it? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, no update just yet. We're still going through the process, and it's probably too early to comment. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kristen Stewart,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Thank you.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your next question is from Rajeev Jashnani with UBS. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Jashnani,  UBS - Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My question, first on the Consumer business, it looked like OTC had a nice rebound. I was wondering if you could talk about where you're at with bringing those products back to the market. I think you had previously talked about having the key products back by the end of the year. Is this on track? Are you perhaps doing a little bit better there? And then as a corollary to that, the margins in the consumer business are obviously quite depressed right now, and maybe talk about the path to improving margins in that business, over the longer term. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, Rajeev.  Well, we are very pleased with the rebound in the Consumer business. As you saw, the OTC business in the US was up 14%. I think that has to do with two things, the expected roll-out of our products back into the marketplace, but also a pretty healthy, if I can say that in quotes, healthy cold and flu season from our perspective. I think we did benefit from that. I think we're basically on track, as we thought we would be, to return about 75% of the products that were previously off the market, back onto the market. 
So our plan is unfolding as we had predicted it would, and looks like we're going to see a buildup throughout the remainder of the year. There will be intermittent supply differences between the products. So it's not as if 75% of the entire volume is back in the business, but 75% of the brands will be on the shelves by the end of the year. We feel pretty confident about that. 
In terms of managing margins in that business, I think our team of leaders in consumer have done a very good job of managing in a very tough time, and they'll continue to do that, I'm sure, going forward. And as the OTC products return to the marketplace, continue to build back share, that's obviously a very profitable piece of the business. So we would expect that they would improve their margins accordingly. I would caution, though, in terms of making sure that you understand that when these products come back to the market, we're going to do whatever we can to gain share and invest appropriately behind them. So we think that investment now will more than pay off in the future. So we would expect the return of profitability to be tempered in the Consumer business, as we do the right things to bring the products back to market. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Jashnani,  UBS - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you.  Just have one follow-up, if you don't mind, on INVOKANA. Perhaps you could talk about the resources you're putting behind that launch, and I know we'll talk about this in a month or so at the pharma meeting, but where do you see this class in the broader spectrum of diabetes care? Thank you very much. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, Rajeev. Well, let me defer the comment on the broader class of diabetes care until May 23, when we have our experts there. Obviously, I hope you'll be there as will others to hear from our leaders, have much more knowledge about that market. But we're obviously very pleased with having this approval, the first of its class, and the indication, as you know, is broad and the adverse event profile was very manageable. We think this is an important addition to the armamentarium of care for diabetes patients. I'll let Joaquin Duato and others in our business talk about the impact they see overall in the marketplace. 
I would say that overall the pharma business is doing well, really well, so we're very pleased with that, and the launches have done incredibly well, despite the fact that we've seen some competition, as you all know. You all have written very vividly about the new products coming to market in various classes, like in Xarelto's class, and in ZYTIGA's class. Yet the products do well. I say that because we have really focused our efforts on clinically differentiating our products, and I say that about INVOKANA as well, and I think our scientific teams, led by Paul Stoffels and Bill Hait have a done a great job of selecting the right clinical profile for the marketplace, and then coupled with the commercial excellence that's led by Joaquin Duato and his team, that's a great combination. So we feel very good about our progress in the Pharmaceutical marketplace. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Jashnani,  UBS - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One more question? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rajeev Jashnani,  UBS - Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I did. I apologize, I know I'm dragging on. But just, Dominic, you take the pharma business, you said it's doing quite well, Consumer there's some opportunity for margin perhaps longer term. How do you feel about the long-term margin trajectory of the Company? That's it for me. Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Look, we have good, healthy margins today. We're managing through what I mentioned at our call in January, when I was with you all, that as of now we have $1 billion of costs of US healthcare legislation embedded in our business, and we're able to manage through that. So I give our business leaders around the world a lot of credit for being able to manage in the various dynamics of the marketplace, including slower-growth markets and including areas of the business where cost pressures are continuing. So I think we've done a good job at doing that, and I expect we'll continue to do a good job at doing that, and we'll always keep a focus on investing appropriately for the future. Each time we give guidance, hopefully you'll get a clear picture of how we're doing that, while also investing in the future. I'll say it's not easy, but I give a lot of credit to the teams of people and leaders around the world who are expert at being able to manage well in challenging times.

Rajeev Jashnani,  UBS - Analyst    [34]

Your next question is from Derrick Sung from Sanford Bernstein. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derrick Sung,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to go back to procedure volumes, and in particular, get some color from you on what you're seeing in Europe. On the MD&D side, how much of that selling days impacted your European sales, and maybe if you could comment specifically on orthopedics, how much of the slowdown there was selling days versus procedure volumes? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, sure. I'll ask Louise to help me with that. But of course in Europe you have the dynamics of the Easter holiday season as well as -- that was in the first quarter of this year, compared to the second quarter of last year. And Louise, maybe you can give some more specifics on the particular question that Derrick's asking. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, so in the US it was about one day, and in Europe it was probably about two days, and that's rather a rough calculation, but it impacted growth about 1.5% in terms of sales, about 1% in the US, and about I think 2.5% outside the US. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derrick Sung,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. But generally speaking, your sense is that -- are you seeing any change, say, from Q4 in terms of sort of austerity measures, procedure volumes, things of that nature, anything noticeable that you'd call out. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In terms of the austerity measures, it's very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. We are still feeling it, as everybody else is feeling it.  We are the first Company that's out, so we need to wait for the others to report. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derrick Sung,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While you're going through those numbers, Louise, would you mind giving us the price mix breakdown for hips knees and spine in the US? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. So in the US, in the first quarter, price was down about 4%, and that's fairly similar to what it was in the fourth quarter, a little bit more unfavorable. And in terms of mix, it was actually 1% favorable, so you came out to about a 3% unfavorable for the hips. In terms of knees, it's about 2% unfavorable, 1.5%, 2% unfavorable, and totally offset by favorable mix. Actually come to about 0.5 point favorable on the knees. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derrick Sung,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What about spine? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And in terms of spine, we are about 3% negative in price, and again, this is only US, and we are positive in terms of mix by about 4%, so netting about 1% positive. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Derrick Sung,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc. - Analyst    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Great. Thank you. And maybe just one more quickly for Dominic. I noticed that in your special items, you increased accrual due to pending litigation on product liability. I was wondering if you could comment there, remind us on the total amount of accruals that you're taking, and maybe also, if you could comment on how sort of the pending product litigation might impact your thinking around use of cash as you move forward? Just help us kind of get comfortable with that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With respect to the total accrual comment, Derek, I'm not going to comment specifically. I'd just refer you to our 10-K disclosures regarding the status of the various legal matters. In terms of use of cash, these litigation accruals obviously sometimes extend for years until the actual cash is disbursed. Although we contemplated in our cash planning, I don't necessarily associate the specific accrual in any one quarter, any one year with cash impact in any quarter, any year. I'm happy to say, as you know, we generate substantially strong cash flows year-in and year-out, and obviously, we'll continue to focus on that.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next question is from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Butler,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'd like to focus for a minute if we could within the Pharmaceutical division, and particularly again with ZYTIGA. There was a patient assistance program in Q4. I assume that had concluded, and actually led to fairly substantial sales in Q1, and I'm curious if we can break that apart. That is to say, does that effect continue into Q2? 
Second part of the question is around international demand, which was up 22% sequentially, and again, very, very strong demand. Was that due to new countries which were added? I realize, Louise,  I think you mentioned 70-odd, 79 particular countries which were approved, but still extremely strong growth and I recognize there was a pre-chemo approval earlier in the year. Was that the principal driver? The last question again, on the same product, really is, is there any attempt to give some consideration or strategy around the patent extension of the product? Thanks very much. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll take the first one on the patient assistance. We have a patient assistance program in place and it continues to be in place. It's part of what we do for all of our products. What you saw in the fourth quarter was a replenishment to the wholesalers of certain of the ZYTIGA products, so it has nothing to do with whether or not we have implemented a patient assistance program. We always have patient assistance programs in place for people that need the products. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With respect to the balance of the questions on ZYTIGA, I'm going to not comment currently on the status of patent extension strategies, except to say that obviously our teams are working on that. In terms of the overall impact of ZYTIGA's worldwide sales, other than what Louise mentioned on patient assistance, which is not really a major impact, the major impacts you did see were the chemo-naive indication, and you're absolutely right, Tony, a number of new markets outside the US, specifically in Europe, came online during the quarter, and will continue to come online for the balance of the year. So those two factors, pre-chemo and additional country approvals, are the major drivers of the uptake in ZYTIGA sales. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Butler,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks very much, Dominic.

Operator    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your next question from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rick Wise,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A couple of things. Dominic, back to the US weakness question. Did you actually expect the stronger US performance, ex all the noise, and did the acceleration -- did the weakness that you clearly saw, and are talking about, did it accelerate or pick up throughout the quarter, or was it just consistently below fourth-quarter trends? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, Rick, good morning. So just to clarify your question, the weakness that you're referring to in the US is in the medical device business. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rick Wise,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm sorry, yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not in Pharma. Not in Consumer. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rick Wise,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exactly. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You're right, there's a lot of noise in the quarter and we tried to parse through that, but after parting through all the noise including selling days, et cetera, Louise's  comments indicated that overall, the medical device business is probably flat or modestly increased in the first quarter. The major driver of that is in fact the utilization trends that we did not see accelerate in the first quarter, across primarily the surgery businesses, including outpatient surgeries, et cetera, and some competitive pressures that I mentioned earlier. So I can't comment specifically month by month in the quarter, but I would say that overall, the trends that we saw modest uptick in the fourth quarter, did not persist into the first quarter. So whether that's seasonality in how people use their high-deductible insurance plans or not, we'll have to wait and see as others report, but that may be a contributing factor, and we expected to see some of that in the first quarter. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rick Wise,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And I think you also mentioned Dominic that hospital inventory levels were down, I would say again, because I thought we would be through most of that process. Is there much more to go there, or is that actually something encouraging for later quarters? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think that in this particular quarter, from the best information we have is related to system implementations and other factors in the particular distributors that we deal with, and not something that we would expect to continue happening for the remaining quarters of the year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rick Wise,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One last one. At the January Analyst Day, obviously by talking about exploring strategic alternatives for diagnostics, it seemed like Alex, both by that statement and just his tone, was signaling a bit more active stance towards portfolio review. You're always buying and selling and reviewing, but should we expect a little more active stance now with Alex on board, and given the ongoing challenges? Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, Rick. Well, I think as Alex mentioned in his commentary, that we always obviously look at our portfolio in a strategic way.  I think with changes in the marketplace that we see happening in healthcare, I think it's even more important for us to be very discerning and very deliberate about the places we will play in, where we could make a big difference, and areas where we may not be able to make a difference, or where in fact investment may not be worth it, or the property may be  better in someone else's hands. I don't know that it's precisely related to just Alex being on board, although that's always been a strategic focus of Alex, even before he became CEO, but I think it's also how we adapt and how our management teams adapt to an ever-changing marketplace. I think we'll continue to be deliberate in that regard, and obviously, we'll update you along the way. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rick Wise,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks so much.

Operator    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your next question is from Jami Ruben with Goldman Sachs. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jami Rubin,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic, can you just elaborate a little bit further on the managed Medicaid true-up? I'm kind of confused about that, it kind of came out of left field. You talked about how that impacted immunology and neurology products. Is that a one-time impact, or do these growth rates reflect the organic growth rates that we should anticipate going forward? How do we think about that, with respect to the numbers going forward for future quarters? 
And the other question relates to sequestration. You have a number of products that are reimbursed through Medicare Part B, including REMICADE. And as you know, there was a 2% reduction to Medicare Part B, which impacts Part B's ASP plus 6. So obviously Q1 didn't reflect this, but are you seeing anything out there that could have some impact on your Medicare Part B business? Thanks very much. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, Jami, thanks for the question. Well, with respect to the adjustment for the managed Medicaid rebates, and I'll let Louise provide some additional color here, it's pretty obvious that level of adjustment is not really reflective of the current run rate of the products. So Louise, in her comments, described the fact that excluding that adjustment, the Pharmaceutical business in the US and worldwide, the underlying growth rate was 8%. So it's not the 14% or 11% that you saw in the numbers, because that would be less than transparent, if we told you that. But the underlying growth rate of 8% is something we're very quite proud of, to be honest. So nonetheless, even despite that adjustment, the business is doing very well, with a very healthy growth rate of 8%. 
This adjustment, as I mentioned earlier, relates to a catch-up of Medicaid rebates for managed Medicaid in the states, under the new legislation, and various states across the United States have provided this information, most recently to all Pharmaceutical players, and us in particular. We took a look at all that data now that we have it in hand, although it's not all in hand, so there may be some additional adjustments going forward, and we'll be transparent again, if that should happen. Having said that, the level of rebates in the states that we had previously predicted are now predicted to be lower. That's why we included this adjustment in our sales, because we had previously reflected too high of rebate, for example. So going forward, although the adjustment may not be that significant, the overall level of rebates are expected to be quite lower than we previously thought. 
And with respect to Medicaid Part B and REMICADE, we're obviously aware of the sequestration impact, and you're right, REMICADE's a significant product that's reimbursed under the Medicare Part B. And beginning in April, we instituted a program with our REMICADE infusion customers on their contract, to receive a discount on the continued use of REMICADE to help them deal with and help them offset the impact of this reimbursement that they'll see.

Just for some context, REMICADE's about a third Medicare, and PROCRIT also impacts 60% Medicare.

Your next question is from Danielle with Leerink Swann. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Danielle Antalffy,  Leerink Swann & Company - Analyst    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just wanted to see if you could talk a little about Synthes integration and how that's going, particularly on any potential sales force turnover side, and if there's any change to when we could see accretion on the EPS side of things from Synthes? And to follow up on Rick's question about potentially more activity on the M&A and/or divestiture front, in the context of the med-tech market that we live in today, so the MD&D business, where do you see potential opportunities? Understanding that you just made this big acquisition with Synthes, but maybe even something smaller or another big acquisition, where do you see opportunities in med-tech for growth over the next five-plus years? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Danielle, the integration of Synthes is going well. I would say that the challenge, as we expected, was going to be in the area of integrating the spine sales forces. You may recall that we converted our current legacy DePuy spine business from a distributor-based system to a direct selling basis, which is what Synthes had in mind, was doing, and we had always expected that would be the way to go in the marketplace. So we completed that transition, and I would say there's some disruption that we've seen as a result, not totally unexpected. But in fact, some disruption, but we think that's a short-term issue, because we think that the long-term benefit of having a direct sales force, plus the combination of the two portfolios is something that will allow us to compete very effectively in the spine space. 
In terms of accretion, the focus of the business integration now is really on sales synergies, and we're starting to see some sales synergies, it's too early to give you a specific number on that. The focus is primarily on sales synergies, as opposed to cost synergies, and we expect that will improve as the integration continues to progress throughout this year, and into next. And with respect to M&A and divestiture activities, we're very active always in M&A and divestiture activity, as you know, and with our broad base in healthcare and our broad purview of the medical device sector, we look at all areas of medical device to see where we can make a difference, and what enters into our calculus, Danielle, as you have heard me say before, is not only where we like to play, but where we think the asset is not only better in our hands but has a current valuation that's attractive to us, and is not, for example, over-valued. So we'll always look at that. I can't give you any specifics, but with a broad-based medical device business that we have, there's lots of areas for us to look at to improve on, if in fact that acquisition would create shareholder value. That's our number-one criteria when looking at the acquisition potential. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Danielle Antalffy,  Leerink Swann & Company - Analyst    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Perfect. One quick follow-up on spine if I could. Any changes to underlying reimbursement trends there? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I haven't seen anything in particular in the data, Louise. Have you seen anything? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not that I'm aware of. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Danielle Antalffy,  Leerink Swann & Company - Analyst    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Great. Thanks so much, guys. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With respect to everyone's time, we'll take one more question and then we'll have Dominic sum up with some final remarks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operator    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your final question's from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Miksic,  Piper Jaffray & Co. - Analyst    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just had a follow-up and I'm sorry to beat this dead horse here on the utilization side, but Dominic, just to clarify, the comments that you're making about trends, general surgery trends, in the past, sometimes these have been coming out of your suture business and the scope and visibility you have into surgery, and in the past, sometimes that's been a trailing indicator. I'm wondering, just to be clear, are these metrics that you're able to provide color up through March, or is part of this through December? Just a clarification. Then I have one follow-up. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me have Louise answer that. She has the data right in front of her. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have good data up to the fourth quarter. As you know, we're one of the first ones out in the first quarter. We do a lot of market research. We have a very good team that extracts data from other companies' reports, from quite frankly analyst reports, that's kind of an amalgamation of it. It's not precise. It's where we think it's directional at this point in time, and of course, we'll know a lot more once we get the data from the other companies. There's some noise in our suture numbers in the quarter, and if I take out that noise in the suture numbers it's flat on a worldwide basis, and it's actually positive about 2% on a US basis, excluding the noise that we had in our own numbers at that point. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Miksic,  Piper Jaffray & Co. - Analyst    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That would compare to the prior quarter? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Similar result, similar. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Miksic,  Piper Jaffray & Co. - Analyst    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. So sort of similar side ways, if you will, from a growth standpoint.  And then the other follow-up I had was on -- I appreciate all the color on price and mix. You had given some particular color on spine over the last few quarters, and knees and spine started to kind of trend positive on a price plus mix basis. Having lived through the last several years, that's an anomaly a little bit for us, I think. And I just wanted to get a sense if you have any color as to why -- what's improving there, what's enabling you to either moderate the pricing pressure or get back on, effectively drive mix. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I think mix comes from innovation of new products, and that's where the positive mix impact is coming from. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's right, Louise. We can't ever lose track of the fact that innovation is the name of the game in all these markets. As we continue to innovate, hopefully we'll get a positive mix equation out of it, and that's what our leaders and folks in the labs and our engineers, et cetera, are totally focused on. They do a pretty good job of it. We'll just continue to look for that as hopeful, in terms of mix being positive, because overall price, regardless of mix, is going to be pretty hard to come by, as you all know. I think our focus has always been, needs to continue to be, on innovating in these markets. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matt Miksic,  Piper Jaffray & Co. - Analyst    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks so much. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Louise Mehrotra,  Johnson & Johnson - VP of IR    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final remarks? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominic Caruso,  Johnson & Johnson - VP Finance & CFO    [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, Louise. Thanks. Thanks everyone for tuning in today. As I said earlier, we're off to a very good start in Q1 and we remain optimistic for the remainder of the year. We see further opportunities to drive growth in this dynamic global marketplace, as our new products, our robust pipelines, and even our core businesses continue to address the critical unmet healthcare needs of patients and customers. I would like to again thank the people of Johnson & Johnson for their dedication and commitment, and I look forward to updating you all on our progress throughout the year, including at our upcoming Pharmaceutical business review on May 23rd. So thanks for your time this morning, and have a great day.
