Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Kraft Foods Group Inc. reports first-quarter results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. 
(Operator Instructions) 
As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Christopher Jakubik, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Christopher Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - VP of IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining us. With me are Tony Vernon, our CEO, and Tim McLevish, our CFO. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ, due to risks and uncertainties. These are discussed in our press release and Form 10-K. We'll also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our press release and in the IR section of KraftFoodsGroup.com. 
With that out of the way, I'd like to start today's discussion with a few words on productivity. As you can see in our results we're making good progress in this area, but we need to carry this to everything we do at the Company. So consistent with our focus on productivity, we've set a goal to complete today's quarterly business update in well less than an hour. We believe our first quarter results are straightforward enough to achieve that goal, and we hope you'll appreciate the effort. So without further delay, I'll turn it over to Tony and Tim to discuss the quarter, and our outlook for the remainder of the year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everybody. The last time we provided you with a financial update, this past February, our results reflected a significant number of post-spin initiatives that we'd undertaken to lay the foundation for a remade Kraft. In many ways, today's results are the first to reflect business as usual at Kraft. Even though we're operating as business unusual, given the many changes we're making to create the best North American food and beverage company. So, how did we do? On the top line, we drove profitable growth, and continued to see the benefits of improved franchise health in a large part of our portfolio. Revenue grew 2.1% from a solid 2.4% gain in volume and product mix, despite a 70 basis point impact from product line pruning. 
Now, while Easter timing added between 0.5 and 1 point of growth, in large part Q1 growth was driven by successful new product innovations. Innovations such as VELVEETA cheesy skillets, up more than 30% over last year, and that's coming off strong double-digit growth throughout 2012. Lunchables, also continuing a strong growth trend, up in the mid single digits, driven by smoothie innovation and increased advertising investment. In coffee, newly launched Maxwell House and Gevalia cups, compatible with the current system, are helping us to expand our presence in the on-demand segment. All of our new coffee SKUs are showing good velocities and distributions in line with our expectations. And we continue to grow strongly in the category that we created, liquid water enhancers. We introduced MiO Fit earlier this year, and we're now following it with our newest entries under our Crystal Light and Kool-Aid brands. 
We're also proving that when we execute our good, better, best strategy, it works beautifully. One shining example is sandwich cheese. To date, VELVEETA has been an untapped gem in our portfolio. It's always been a value in the dairy case, and a nice flanker to our other offerings. But through product formulation improvements, new flavors, updated packaging and increased distribution, VELVEETA has strengthened its relevance and expanded its role into the cheese slices category. And as to good, better, best, VELVEETA slices are priced at $1.99, complementing Kraft Singles at $2.99 and Deli Deluxe at $3.99. So in the first quarter, the good work done with VELVEETA slices helped us deliver a profitable 2 point share gain in this category. 
Across the total Kraft portfolio, our market share performance is improving, but we're still not where we want to be. In the first quarter, we outpaced the industry on a unit basis, but not in as many categories as I know we're capable of. Also, our dollar growth lagged the industry in the first quarter. Now, as you may recall, we priced up with commodity costs earlier than most of the industry last year, and this has negatively impacted comparisons versus the industry this year. Nonetheless, we expect to do better on both a dollar and unit basis versus the industry, as this year progresses. The growth we delivered in the quarter was driven by innovation, stepped up advertising, and investments in our Big Bet franchises. A&C was up mid-teens for these brands, and collectively they grew revenue in the mid single digits in the first quarter. But there's more work to do, more brands to revitalize, with the right levels of investment, and I'll talk about where we go from here in a moment. 
In sum, we had solid revenue growth in the first quarter. And similar to the end of last year, we feel good about the fact that our retail inventories were in line with historic norms as we closed out the quarter. Now, Tim, why don't you talk about operating income? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, Tony. In the first quarter, we continued to see strong productivity gains from our Lean Six Sigma efforts, and our overhead cost savings are coming through as we redesign our support functions at both the business unit and corporate levels. As a result, we delivered 9% growth in operating income, despite more than $60 million of higher restructuring program costs versus the first quarter of last year. At the same time, I don't want you to think that we're off to the races in terms of underlying profit and earnings growth. As we've said before, our path to becoming the best North American food and beverage company is a marathon, not a sprint. Or more specifically, we're pacing for a two-hour marathon versus a four-minute mile. The fact is, while we delivered outstanding cost savings and productivity in the quarter, these savings ran ahead of our brand-building efforts. And remember, our goal is to build this business for the long-term, and deliver solid growth on both the top and bottom lines across our portfolio each year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right, Tim. And to that end, while we're making progress on many fronts, there's more progress to be made. In the months ahead, you'll see us spend back a greater portion of our cost savings on brand-building than was the case in the first quarter. This will be done on two fronts. First, we'll revitalize and contemporize more of our iconic brands. At the end of January we created the position of Chief Marketing Officer, in order to leverage deep experience on the front lines of brand marketing across our entire organization, and help make our brands shine in new and powerful ways. 
A great example of the revitalization effort is Kool-Aid, a true icon in food and beverage. Retail consumption of Kool-Aid Jammers was up 30% in first quarter, providing an important value run in the good, better, best ladder for ready-to-drink beverages. And with the introduction of new Kool-Aid liquid water enhancers, the brand is expanding beverage platforms yet again. And with the launch of a new look and voice for the Kool-Aid man just last month, our full marketing playbook for Kool-Aid is now in action. We aim to take a brand that was under $400 million just over a year ago, and make it our newest $0.5 billion dollar brand this year. 
One of our other iconic gems is Grey Poupon. In first quarter, it saw its first big dose of advertising in more than 15 years, and it's coming back, behind a program with very attractive returns on investment. And in the coming months, you'll see more reinvestment, and the commitment to revitalize brands like Jell-O and Planters. In fact, in the first half alone we're launching 10 new brand advertising campaigns across our portfolio, and in the presentation we provided a link on this slide so you can see for yourself all of the good work that our marketers and their agencies are producing. 
At the same time, where we've achieved success we will defend it and build upon it, which is the second area of our reinvestment. Waking up sleeping giants attracts attention, and others want a piece of their success. Here I'm talking about products like Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Kraft Salad Dressing, Oscar Mayer Cold Cuts, Miracle Whip and Kraft Mayonnaise, where we've seen new, aggressive, competitive entries. We will be investing to both defend and grow these franchises with every page in our playbook -- better marketing, innovation, and good, better, best differentiation versus the competition. In select instances, defending our success may also mean getting sharper on price points, to show that we will not tolerate incursions into our market share or irrational behavior that would disrupt the long-term health of our categories. Fortunately, in those instances, we are still at a point in our productivity curve that will allow us to take action without having to take a step back in terms of profit growth. Now back to Tim. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's a good segue to our productivity and overhead cost management initiatives. While we're pleased with our progress to date, we still have room to go to get to lowest cost producer status and world-class overhead efficiency. Our plants and supply chain are still making strides on Lean Six Sigma. In manufacturing, substantially all of our key manufacturing lines are now at Three Sigma, but only 15% have achieved Four Sigma certification. In other parts of our supply chain, we're still at the early stages of tapping Lean Six Sigma principles and implementing integrated business planning. And in overheads, we're still chasing best-in-class, and our target is to beat that by leveraging our meaningful scale advantage versus our peers. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But I would add that none of this, the brand-building, the procurement saving, the overhead cost reductions, will be possible if we don't move quickly to make our people our competitive advantage. We absolutely believe that combining our leading brands with a winning culture, world-class recruiting and training, and a deep commitment to our communities, can create for all of our employees a mission bigger than themselves, and real competitive advantage for Kraft. To that end, we're taking some big steps. The best brand portfolio in our industry, with 10 brands over $500 million, and 29 over $100 million in sales, deserves the best marketers. So we've revamped and retargeted campus recruiting to bring top talent into our organization, and we are thrilled to be bringing in our largest recruiting class in recent history. In addition, earlier this week we officially launched our Kraft University, and will be building course requirements as part of our career planning for all of our people. Like we said, we're making progress on many fronts, but there's more progress to be made and more opportunity to capture on all fronts. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now let's turn to the EPS bridge. We had significant earnings gains from operations, with good performance at both the gross profit and operating income levels. Gross profit performance reflected volume growth, improved product mix, and productivity savings. This was partially offset by pricing net of costs, as our pricing fell modestly behind commodity cost changes in certain parts of our portfolio. 
At the SG&A line, overhead costs were down sharply. This reflected the many actions we're taking across the organization, such as delayering our corporate sales function to lower our overall sales expense. It also included some modest benefit from the changes we made in post-employment accounting last year, and that more than offset cost dis-synergies resulting from the separation. Taken together, the progress made on all mix, productivity and overhead, more than covered the accelerated restructuring costs, at a solid A&C increase in the quarter. Below the line, as you would have anticipated, interest expense now reflects our capital structure as an independent Company. Therefore, interest expense was $123 million, resulting in a $0.13 EPS impact in the quarter. 
Looking ahead to the full year, we're on track to deliver our 2013 guidance. We continue to expect to grow revenue in line with the North American food and beverage market. We'll do this despite an approximate 1 percentage point impact from extraordinary product line pruning, largely in our food service business. On the bottom line, we continue to expect to deliver approximately $2.75 of earnings per share for 2013, and this includes restructuring program costs in line with previous guidance, approximately $300 million for the year. I would point out that having incurred nearly $120 million in the first quarter, we expect to realize about two-thirds of the $300 million during the first half of the year. As far as the distribution of earnings across quarters goes, no doubt you've already done the math to figure out that $0.76 of EPS in Q1 equates to about 27% or 28% of our full year $2.75 guidance. So to reflect the timing of the stepped up investments in brand-building Tony mentioned earlier, we're updating our estimate of earnings seasonality for 2013. We now expect the split of our earnings to be roughly 50/50, versus our previous expectation for a 48% first-half, 52% second-half split. 
In our other area of focus, cash, we're delighted to report positive free cash flow in Q1. For those of you who have followed Kraft for a while, you know that Q1 has typically been a quarter that results in a net use of cash from operations. So what changed? We delivered strong earnings, and also saw a meaningful improvement in our management of working capital. This reflects our efforts to institute sound working capital practices, practices more consistent with a cash-focused, return-oriented business model. It resulted in better working capital efficiency than we experienced in the first quarter of last year. Going forward, we would expect Q1 free cash flow to be closer to neutral in future years. 
In summary, the focus on cash, and our cash is king messaging, is taking hold across the organization. Not just in working capital efficiency, but across all aspects of the business where decisions impact cash. And rest assured, we're working hard to deliver upside to our guidance of at least $1 billion of free cash flow in 2013, through more efficient use of working capital, capital expenditure discipline, and better cash-focused decisions across the enterprise.

Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So I'll close in the same way I started. We're off to a solid start to the year, with strong cost savings momentum as the wind at our back. But there's still more work to do, and I'm thrilled to say, more reinvestment to make, to fulfill our vision for long-term, sustainable growth. We'd now like to answer your questions.

Alexia Howard,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, everyone. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning, Alexia. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alexia Howard,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, so could I ask you a little about the marketing spending? Are you able to quantify how much that was down year-on-year this particular quarter, and what the outlook is for the full year in terms of how you expect the full year to shape out? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. It wasn't down in the quarter, Alexia. It was up double-digits in terms of the A&C, which is our key measure. In terms of how much we'll invest going forward, I would tell you this isn't a precise science. You're not going to see savings and reinvestment align perfectly every quarter. Our quarterly earnings pacing reflects the toggling of stepped up brand investments vis-a-vis the flow of the cost savings. 
It's important to us that we ensure we don't create disruption or cause inefficiency in either area by trying to manage quarterly earnings, and you know we make these investment decisions on margin, materiality, momentum and, frankly, message. If all those things are right, we'll invest. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alexia Howard,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. And then maybe just one follow-up on the gross margin side. Looks as though the gross margins were up in the quarter. I'm curious about how you see that playing out going forward, and in particular, what the commodity cost situation looks like today and how that might look through the rest of the year? Thank you. And I'll pass it on after that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alexia, we're very focused on better managing input costs than we are forecasting them. I think you have a pretty good sense for what's happening in the commodity world, and those that impact us. But we're confident that with the continued strengthening of our brand, and further investment that Tony talked about, that we will be able to manage pricing to accommodate those to maintain or grow our margin -- our gross margins. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alexia Howard,  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, good afternoon. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, Bryan. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First question, just in terms of revenue growth in the quarter, it looked like vol mix especially was a lot better than what we could see in the scanner data. So could you talk a little bit about just the -- maybe the difference between what you reported and the scanner data, and maybe bridge that difference for us? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. Our year-on-year vol mix in Q1 was better than the recent scanner data would have suggested. This was probably due to comparisons, as the trade was working down inventories of Capri Sun, coffee and cheese during the first quarter of 2012, and related to some pricing activity occurring in the year-ago period. So I think you have to look to last year to help  explain it totally. But bottom line as we ended the quarter with retail inventories at normal levels for this time of year, and I think the unit share gains you see are probably the best indicator of what's happening on the brands, because we took pricing earlier, as I mentioned in the speech, last year than pretty much all of the industry. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then just as a follow-up to that, we've begun to hear a little bit about maybe some concern across the industry that maybe it starts to get a little bit more price competitive as there's some more gross margin flexibility, and you even alluded a little bit to that I guess in some of the categories that you pointed out in the prepared remarks. So can you just comment on  where you see today the state of the consumer, and maybe just that competitive dynamic, maybe relative to what you were seeing when the year started? Do you think it's any better, worse or the same, versus  what your outlook might have been back in February? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I think if you listen to our customers and, for instance, most recently the restaurant industry, it's not getting better. It might even be, based on some of those comments, getting worse for that lower-end consumer on the barbell. We certainly see a consumer intensely focused on value for the money, and that's why we continue to see the need to innovate and ensure that our good, better, best offerings span as many categories as we have them. 
We're confident, and we continue to be pretty confident, the elasticities are reflecting our equity and innovation investment. And I point to the volume growth this quarter as a pretty good sign; certainly we're in a marathon, not a sprint. But offering value at every rung on the price ladder is critical, and when we do it, we do quite well. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello. Good evening. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, Chris. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just hope I can apply your productivity program to writing my note tonight as well. I hope I get that done in a reasonable amount of time. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [23]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You need any help, let us know (laughter). 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, sure. Right, okay. So I just had two quick ones for you. The first one is just that there were two divisions in cheese and beverage where you cited a drag on profits from pricing net of cost declines. I was just curious if you could speak to those two divisions, and what was going on in them, and why pricing was down, it sounds like at a faster rate than what the input cost was down? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll take that one. Cheese pricing was down modestly, and we probably got caught with a little bit longer position going into the quarter, and as we saw cheese prices coming down, we were a bit unfavorable there. And by the way, this was a modest shortfall. It wasn't a huge one. And we in ordinary course, we do have a strong PNOC, what we call pricing net of cost, discipline, but it will vary a little bit over the quarter. So a quarter's a little bit too discrete a period to really draw any conclusions from. 
Within beverage, what you saw is coffee was pretty balanced. But we did invest a little bit in trade to support some new entrants to our position in the liquid enhancers business with our MiO. So we invested a little bit in trade. That caused a little bit of imbalance there. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The only thing I'd add, Chris, is Easter on cheese is a hugely promotional time, and so you're comparing to a year ago where Easter was later, and you see a lot of high/low customers really pushing especially these great Kraft brands. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, that's very helpful. And I just had one other question for you in relation to the -- really I guess for Tim. There were some pension benefits, if you will, that came through this quarter, and also you mentioned some cost dis-synergy. Is that something you could quantify, or give us some sense of whether that's for the quarter or how it may phase through the year? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll give you a little sense for it, Chris. First of all, it was a -- there's a number of impacts from pension. So you recall, we made some pretty significant changes to how we account for changes -- or for pension in the fourth quarter of last year. That actually was quite a small contribution, probably $0.02 worth of benefit from the accounting change last year. That was more than offset by some of the pension costs and post-employment costs that we assumed from Mondelez, of already retirees, as we talked to in the past, so that more than offset that piece of it. 
We did -- as we have restructured the Company, and as we have reduced our overall headcount, it has been an appreciable benefit from just the lower pension cost as a result of that. From a dis-synergy standpoint, we assumed $0.02 or $0.03 worth of dis-synergies, just as we are now operating as a stand-alone Company. So again, that more than offset the impact of the pension adjustments. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. That was helpful. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As we go forward, I would expect those pension costs to largely flow through. The cost savings will be a little bit imbalanced, because of some fourth quarter catch-up accounting, and a mark-to-market basis. But for practical purposes, the pension accounting adjustment will flow through, as will the additional cost associated with assuming the Mondelez pensionees. And the dis-synergies I would expect to largely flow through each quarter. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [31]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Those should wind down, though, through the year, the cost of synergies or --? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The cost savings will start coming through a little bit stronger, Chris, so -- as we move through. I think there were some pension favorabilities in the fourth quarter of last year, that once you get to the fourth quarter this year, it will be a bit more of a headwind. So first three quarters, you -- should look largely like what you've seen in this quarter. I think as you get into the fourth quarter, the comparisons will get a little bit tougher. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks a lot.

Andrew Lazar, Barclays. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon,. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, Andrew. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the first-half/second-half earnings guidance piece, I guess you're now expecting to deliver a higher percentage of EPS in the first half than before, but while absorbing fully two-thirds of the restructuring in the first half. So is that just, again, partly conservatism, or is it again based on just the plans around when and how you step up your marketing spend in the second half? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I mean, we had a good, solid first quarter, perhaps modestly better than we had anticipated. Understand, the second quarter will be a bit impeded by an earlier Easter this year that we benefited in the first quarter rather than the second quarter and really it's a modest shift from the first quarter -- I mean from the first -- from the second half to the first half, just a couple of percentage points both on the top line and bottom line expectation. And I think we will balance that because as we said, our cost savings, both in productivity and overhead reduction,  got ahead of some of our spending on brand investment, but we will catch that up and better balance it over the rest of the year. So we think that's pretty reflective of what we would expect to see first-half/second-half. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Thanks for that. And then Tony, picking up on your elasticity commentary, you guys obviously cover -- picking up on your elasticity commentary you guys covered a lot of categories that you span across in the aisles. I guess have you -- part of the thesis, right, of the group as a whole as the group laps pricing, that was the biggest impact to volumes last year, and volumes will start to come back. And that's been  very gradual at best I guess for the industry at this point, and are you at least in your category starting to see that take place at  the rate that you would have expected, given how quickly you and others are starting to lap the pricing? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [40]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, it is -- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It seems disappointing from an industry perspective, that's all. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I can't comment on the other guys, but it certainly is the key objective of big brand players and our customers to grow volume in those retail stores. And it's very much category by category, Andrew, which you basically said in your opening. For us, it's always whether we're executing our playbook completely in those categories to drive volume at every rung on the price ladder, and certainly the lowest rung on the ladder becomes critical when the consumer is crunched. 
Right now, I think I'm not taking a big bow for first quarter, maybe 50% of a bow, because 2 points of volume growth is pretty positive given what this industry has done over the last couple of years, but I don't think we're looking at this on a 4- or even 13-week basis. We're looking at this for the long term, and our goal is to execute this playbook against a great portfolio of brands, to do exactly what you're talking about, drive volume in as many of our key categories as we can.

Good evening. I have a question just about the cheese division for a minute. Going back to that, I would have thought that quarter would have been a challenge lapping what was a big quarter a year ago, and going through the quarter, the input cost picture got less and less scary, perhaps a little bit more benign for margins for the industry. Could you  review what  quarter you thought that was for that division? Was that environment, perhaps from a commodity standpoint, more benign than what you had originally thought for that quarter? I realize in one of your comments you said you bought -- pre-bought a lot of supply. I'm gathering you might have thought that prices would have ramped-up harder? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, you know, I want to tell you that if I were to point to any division to say the Kraft model can work, it's cheese. Because you'll recall years, David, where this was the albatross, in your guys' words, around Kraft's neck. The truth is you're looking at brands called Philly, VELVEETA, Kraft Singles and Cracker Barrel, and while commodities are important, these are great brands, whether they got commodities in them or not. We're talking about 16% growth on VELVEETA cheese. Who would have thunk it, right, years ago. So I would say this is a division that's executing the playbook beautifully. They're managing their commodities well. I don't think it was any more benign or worse than we thought. 
I think this is just now, going on two-plus years, a story of a business that's been revitalized against great brands that the consumer and customer can drive volume. Talk about driving volume. I mean, the cheese business, frankly, from a volume standpoint has sustained volume growth. So the obvious question that comes up is, how do we maintain the margins on something that's looking pretty good, right? I would just say that margins quarter-to-quarter in this business can fluctuate quite a bit with input cost levels. We're in it for the long term. We're focusing on profitable growth. And in this business, we've grown profit dollars, I think, in five of the last eight quarters, if not more. I think there's more opportunity in this division, as we take out cost and we innovate. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Palmer,  UBS - Analyst    [47]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If I could just squeeze one more, on just coffee. We just you saw some fairly -- not that impressive numbers from the CPG division of Starbucks. K-Cups don't seem to be doing the bull case scenario in a lot of people's minds out there. I mean, what is your review of that segment in particular, single-serve? Is that doing -- how is that doing versus your expectations? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, can't comment on Starbucks of course. (laughter) I will tell you, I mean, it's too early to take this bow, but I'm going to tell you that we're holding or growing coffee shares in all three of our key segments right now. I haven't been able to say that since I got to Kraft. I'm talking mainstream is holding, and we're growing a little bit of share in K-Cups and in premium. Gevalia has turned out to be a real nice player in premium for us. 
So overall for us, share's improving. I think the on-demand segment has a long way to go. It's got 12% or 14% penetration. Canada has high 20%s. Europe has high 30%s. I think this is in the early innings of a great innovation game, and we feel pretty good about our K-Cup compatible offerings in Maxwell House and Gevalia so far. And we look forward to offering Tassimo and our K-Cup compatibles to ride the growth in that category.

Great. Thanks a lot. Good evening, everyone. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, David. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Driscoll,  Citigroup - Analyst    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wanted just to -- on Easter, I think what you guys have said is that there's was something like $45 million of sales impact, and maybe that would translate into about an $8 million profit impact in the quarter that would have shifted in from the second quarter, Tim, is that about right? Is that math roughly correct? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, David, I think when you look at it, we did say there was an Easter shift of between 0.5 point to 1 point on the top line, I think, just doing the math off of average margins. However, I would mention, though, that if you think about it conceptually, and we still need to  go to school on this a little bit more, but it could well be that you'd see a little bit of a greater profit shift now with the Easter shift than the top line would indicate. Only because the products that sell at Easter tend to be a bit higher profit margin for us. 
Our historic analysis would have included, say, the snacks business, the North American snacks business that's now with Mondelez, which didn't really have a lot of Easter shift in cookies and crackers, for instance, so the profit shift was dampened by that. So we need to go to school a little bit more on that. But I think theoretically, conceptually, there could well be a little bit more of a shift from Easter at the operating income line than would have been the case historically. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Driscoll,  Citigroup - Analyst    [55]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I really appreciate that color. On beverages, I have to admit I'm not even confident of this question here, but in the fourth quarter did you actually have a negative operating income in beverages, and then in this quarter it looks like it was quite strong operating income? I'd love to hear you talk about that fourth quarter piece and then just  sequentially, because I'm trying to get my head wrapped around what's going on in beverage income? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, David. I mean, you're right, that was -- operating income was negative in the fourth quarter of last year. You can see from the disclosures, there was some restructuring in there, but even when you separate that out it was lower year-on-year for -- and lower in the absolute for a number of reasons. But as you look at this year, I think when you look at the first quarter, there was an improvement, but it was more -- I guess a bit normalized. If you look at, say, first quarter beverage profitability in 2012 versus 2011, it was down year-on-year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was down very significantly. It was down almost 40% in the first quarter of 2012. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Right, right. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But building off a particularly weak quarter. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. So I think it should have been (multiple speakers) -- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're making good progress in beverage and we're getting that business back on track. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Driscoll,  Citigroup - Analyst    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But the fourth quarter, did it affect the first quarter? Somehow, do profits move from 4Q to 1Q? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, there wouldn't have been any shift. This is just -- what you're seeing is just pure year-over-year comparison. There wouldn't have been any  extraordinary shift from fourth quarter to first quarter. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Driscoll,  Citigroup - Analyst    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If I could just get one last question in, it's a specific one. On that line in the segment disclosure, the pension cost line, I think it's called certain post-employment benefit plan costs. That's a mouthful. That thing was a $1 million -- I think it's a benefit. We were looking for a fairly significant expense there. I would love to hear just some understanding as to  maybe what happened, and more importantly, what do we do with this thing going forward? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I think when you look at that, David, the year-on-year comparison, what you have in the prior-year first quarter was an allocation of pension costs from Mondelez when it was all one company. What you have right now is a combination of some pension expense and then some pension benefit coming through there, netting out at about $1 million flat. I think as you move forward, it's going to be essentially neutral on that line, as we get to next couple of quarters. And then I think what you also saw there was general corporate expense of about $33 million versus $1 million last year. That's largely your dis-synergies, and reflects the cost of being an independent public company. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And some restructuring costs. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And some restructuring costs in that line, right. So I think it was like $13 million. But I think as we move forward, you're looking at about -- in corporate expense roughly about $25 million a quarter, is what we're operating at. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Driscoll,  Citigroup - Analyst    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Really appreciate it. Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [69]

Good evening, everyone. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, Ken. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Zaslow,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony, you made a reference to basically quashing flankers in certain categories. Can you talk about what categories, and what actions you're taking to make sure this doesn't become an issue? It seems like that was something you wanted to target a little bit? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Did you say squashing? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Zaslow,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I said quashing but that's -- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quashing. Okay. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Zaslow,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [77]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You took a pretty affirmative action on that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've got to defend and build our key segments, right, and they do attract some real competitors, when you're talking about mac & cheese, with an 80%-plus market share. I did mention several areas where we're focusing. You can see the weaknesses in some select categories in the scanner data. You know, it's pretty obvious, your Nielsen's are our Nielsen's, Salad Dressing, Mayonnaise and Miracle Whip are pitched battles right now. Jell-O is an important one, with a lot of offerings from competitors in that sweet desserts area. We're going to be taking appropriate action. I'm talking about ad campaigns and innovation, and good, better, best pricing to improve our performance. But for competitive reasons, I'd rather let you see it at retail when my competitors see it, than frankly talk about it here. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Zaslow,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, and my follow-up question is, in terms of good, better, best, I think six or seven months ago you alluded to the fact that you had probably about eight categories in that good, better, best, and you were moving towards trying to get more and more of those categories. Can you talk about where you are on the progression of getting good, better, best pricing is? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. We talked about the eight categories -- cold cuts; mac & cheese; processed slices, shredded cheese; ready-to-drink with Kool-Aid Jammers; Capri Sun; and Capri Sun Fruit & Vegetable; coffee, I think I mentioned earlier, I see real progress in frankly the fruits of a lot of good efforts by our coffee team to go after coffee. Probably not going to talk about the areas, for competitive reasons. I think you could argue liquid water enhancers, we've got quite a portfolio of good, better, best there, when you're talking about Kool-Aid, Crystal Light and MiO, and frankly, you can see other beverage brands that might appeal. That's a new one by definition, and I think this quarter we're growing high double digits. So, more to come. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Zaslow,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [81]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Moskow,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, thanks. You know, in the last quarter I think we spent probably 30 minutes talking about Oscar Mayer and refrigerated meals, and the sales being down, and losing business with a big customer, and it's like this quarter sales are up 2.5% and it's like it never even happened. So before I get to excited about it, can you tell me if this is a seasonal issue, or how did sales turn positive in first quarter in that division? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You're opening my business unit, I thought I talked about it too much, too (laughter). So, hey, the cold cuts area is still a pitched battle, and frankly the category is soft, and I think there's something going on in the deli fresh segment. Frankly, there's some great innovations from those competitors that you typically don't see in your Nielsen definition, and we follow that pretty closely, because when we introduced carving board and all of our deli-shaved innovation, one of our goals was to grow our segment versus that deli fresh segment. They've now responded, and I think you can see some of that affecting our industry, cold cuts, and Kraft/Oscar Mayer itself. 
So  trading back and forth, and we know that exists because we've got some good data on it. Our trends are improving, thank you for noticing, but I think our Oscar Mayer team would be the first to admit that they want to continue to do better in cold cuts, which is a critical category for Kraft. I do want to call out, by the way, they're doing beautifully in bacon, up 14% this quarter, and Lunchables, which just continues to grow. A lot of good Easter momentum there, too. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [85]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good evening. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello Eric. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey, I appreciate Rob giving me his five minutes, because I'll use them. I guess first question is just more detail, Tim, on the $62 million of asset write-offs and exit costs versus the total $112 million of restructuring, where is that difference allocated versus cost of goods or SG&A? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [90]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You know, Eric, that's all -- it's within Schedule 1, there's a footnote in the press release, and that lays it all out. It was I think $119 million total in the quarter, and then up in cost of goods you had $24 million, SG&A you had $33 million. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Thank you. And then I guess from the Analyst Day in September to then CAGNY to then CAGE, CapEx  moved around a lot. Can you just  talk about that a bit, Tim, and I interpreted that -- at the time that it was a $200 [billion] difference in your free cash flow this year, and I guess you're saying it isn't. So, what is the difference, and why such volatility on the CapEx line? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [92]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're a built light in the quarter in CapEx, relative to full-year expectation. And even so, there was some restructuring related that wouldn't -- that is unique to the restructuring program. But we do expect -- continue to expect that CapEx will exceed depreciation for the year by at least $200 million, and so that's what's embedded within our cash flow forecast. Again, the first quarter it was light at $85 million, but we expect it largely to be back on track for the same level that we anticipated. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [93]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maybe I didn't make myself clear. At CAGNY, you had a slide that said about $400 million for the year, and then at CAGE it jumped to $700 million. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [94]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric -- okay. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [95]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So that -- and then there's -- what is -- so that's $300 million more of cash being reinvested, so what is the difference if -- why shouldn't we assume free cash flow is lower by that number, by that difference? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [96]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So Eric, what happened in the footnote at CAGNY that we had to come back and correct was the fact that when we did the add-up on CapEx, the add-up was done in terms of what was happening at the business units. There was an extra bit of CapEx that was related to the restructuring program, as Tim mentioned, that wasn't captured. So it was $700 million all along. There was a bit of mistake in that slide. So when we got to CAGE we updated it, and then the next day we issued the 10-K, which had the right number for CapEx. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [97]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But embedded within our cash flow expectation, that delta was reflected all along. It was just included in a different category. It was included in restructuring as opposed to in CapEx. So that wouldn't have affected -- it doesn't affect our guidance of at least $1 billion of cash for the year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [98]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. I'll follow-up, but okay. And then last two, Tony. I guess I'm -- the group, as you know, has had significant multiple expansion, every company out there is trading at a very nice multiple these days. And yet, your comments about willing to aggressively promote and adjust pricing to keep your share, I think, is a little bit of a scary outlook from the biggest US food company, given valuation. I mean, how should investors  really take such an aggressive comment versus the group's tremendous run, and your stock as well? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [99]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, so I -- obviously, I don't control PE multiples. I wish I did, Eric, but I don't. I don't want you to read too much into my defend and build, because I'm not taking up my trade promotion budget. In fact, I'm more efficient with my trade promotion budget. I think it was more a statement about the fact that we won't let the  cold cuts low rung on the price ladder get away from us, on what is a Top 10 franchise, and we'll take the whole portfolio of our playbook to address it competitively. We remained very focus on profitable, sustainable growth, and you're going to see us use some promotion to adjust price points for commodity costs, but that's about it. We'll always keep an eye towards profitability and brand health. So if I led you to believe that I'm playing games with my trade promotion to drive price points down, I'm not. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [100]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Thanks for that clarification. I'll pass it on. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [101]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me go back to your question on cash flow because I sense that you're skeptical over our ability to deliver our target, and quite frankly we're working very hard as I said to drive more cash. But if you take our EPS guidance, you can pretty -- come pretty close to backing in to what our net income is going to be and, you know, depreciation is a little bit under $400 million, as you can surmise from prior reports. You talked about the $700 million of CapEx, and we've talked about $600 million in pension contribution yet to come in the year. You need to tax-effect that, because we get an immediate tax deduction from that, so you back that down to more like $400 million, and we've said we have about $125 million of tax payment that is still ahead of us. 
That was carryover because we only had three payments in 2012, but that gets you somewhere in the $800 million, $850 million range, and that doesn't include the progress we're making on working capital and other things. We're quite confident that -- we have set a goal over the next two or three years to take 10 to 12 days of cash conversion costs out. Consequently we'll get a jump on it this year. So we're confident that we'll deliver $1 billion. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [102]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. So it's -- thanks for that. It basically comes down to a little bit of timing difference on the after-tax issue, and then an assumption on your part that working capital will offset the difference in the $300 million in CapEx? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [103]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, again, the $300 million of CapEx was already embedded within the cash flow. It just came in on the restructuring line, as opposed to on the depreciation line. So it's just a categorization, not a change in the level. It isn't -- we didn't raise the bar on expectation of working capital. It's just shifting between lines. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [104]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric, when you look at the two disclosures, it was simply a $300 million shift from cash from operations to CapEx. So there was really no change in the total number, no change in forecast, it was just $300 million of CapEx related to restructuring was put in the wrong bucket. That's all. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [105]

All right. Thank you.

Good afternoon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diane Geissler,  GLSA - Analyst    [109]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to ask a clarifying question on your comment regarding the pace of the revitalization of your portfolio, the 8 of the 20 categories that you've covered. My understanding is your run rate per annum is  two to three platforms. And just given your commentary within the script, is that -- are you enhancing that this year? Do you think you'll be running at a faster rate, or is the two to three platforms correct? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [110]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I think, Diane, just to clarify, when I talk about 10 new ad campaigns, that really is not the same as talking about making sure take we're growing our good, better, best in -- from 8 of 20 categories to more of them. I mean, we have today -- and I'd have to check this. We probably have about 20 of our brands advertised, Anglo or Hispanic or both, and we only have good, better, best executed perfectly in eight or nine categories. So I hope -- is that what you're getting at? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diane Geissler,  GLSA - Analyst    [111]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I just want to make sure that I'm not getting ahead of myself in estimating the good, better, best strategy, and  what is the tale of that over the next few years? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [112]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, you had it right. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diane Geissler,  GLSA - Analyst    [113]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, perfect. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [114]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The reality is, this is the great hard part of marketing, right? Where you put together a plan, and you've got to have a message that works and it's got to be tested, and your customers have to like it.  I wish it came easy, but the fun of it is that it's a great, hard journey. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diane Geissler,  GLSA - Analyst    [115]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Great. Thanks for that commentary. And then I wanted to ask about the working capital on a year-over-year basis, and I appreciate the balance sheet we all have from last year is a  carve out from Kraft, KFT. I think you've spoken in the past about maybe even within your own system having some inventory that you needed to phase out. I know you commented on the retailer inventories being in good shape, but I guess could you talk a little about  where within your own system you think those opportunities are, and is that already anything you would have to write off? Would that be predicated already in the restructuring charges that you've given us for this year? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [116]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't anticipate that there would be any material inventory write-offs as we -- I mean, we've already engaged in some product line pruning in excess of normal course. But if there are write-offs, they're  background noise write-offs. I would not be concerned about that. Really, our focus to improve our working capital comes first and foremost, from my perspective, in inventory. But it is better managing the requirements, and I made reference -- I'm not sure everybody understands what exactly it is, but I made reference to integrated business planning. 
That's what many of you know as sales and inventory, and operations planning, is getting better at forecasting and better production planning, and better managing our inventories, to meet the requirements and appropriate service level, but with better forecasting to be able to have the right inventory at the right place when we need it. That's where I see the opportunity is, is just lower the water level and the inventory requirements to still meet those needs, by virtue of better running the business. And that should not require write-offs.

And how far along on that -- in that process do you think you are?

Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [118]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'd say we're second inning. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diane Geissler,  GLSA - Analyst    [119]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Second -- okay. Perfect. Thank you.

Jason English,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [122]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Want to come back to your guidance for first-half/second-half. I've been playing a little model over here, and to get to $2.75 you're implying like a $0.60 earnings quarter. I just can't beat my numbers down that hard. So can you help me understand some of the puts and takes? Is this lumpy restructuring, or is there something else you unique that's going to happen in the second quarter? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [123]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I mean, we've said we've upped -- two-thirds of our restructuring is going to come in the first half. So, there is higher restructuring in the second quarter than  we'd would be spreading $300 million over proportionately. The other thing is, as Tony mentioned and we reinforced, that we expect more brand-building investment. We've got some very good programs with -- in good shape to be rolled out, and we want to get that rolling. Remember that Easter came a bit early, so you've got a bit of seasonality impact there as well, that took it out of the second quarter, put it in the first quarter on a relative basis to last year.
