Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Kraft Foods Group, Inc. report, second-quarter results conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. 
(Operator Instructions) 
As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Chris Jakubik of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, and thanks for joining our quarterly business update. As usual, Tony Vernon, our CEO, and Tim McLevish, our CFO, are with us today, as well. During our remarks we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties. These are discussed in our press release and our Form 10-K. We'll also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP within our press release and in the investor center of KraftFoodGroup.com. 
With that out of the way, I'll now hand it over to Tony and Tim. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Chris. And thanks to all of you for joining us to discuss the puts and takes in our business through the second quarter of this year. On last quarter's call, I talked about our turnaround being a marathon, not a sprint. And the fact that our quarterly earnings pacing would reflect the rate of stepped-up brand investments, vis-a-vis the flow of cost savings. Hopefully, you've all had a chance to read our press release and review our second-quarter financials. The results show we've made further progress on our cost savings initiatives, especially in the way of manufacturing productivity, and faster-than-expected quarterly pacing on the bottom line. At the same time, as you've seen in the scanner data and from our industry peers, there was not as much progress on the top line in the second quarter. 
Organic net revenues were 1.2% lower in Q2. Including a headwind of approximately 1.5 points from a combination of Easter timing and product line pruning. But that is no excuse. Our benchmark is the North American food and beverage industry. And we aim to outperform our benchmark over time. The fact is, with or without the Easter impact, our 1.2% organic revenue decline trailed industry growth, a plus 0.2%. So, let's dive right into what we've seen on the top line and what we're doing about it. As I've said before, we will defend our categories and build upon our successes, with a disciplined focus on the long-term, to grow, and grow profitably. And in the second quarter we invested aggressively in many of our brands, employing the full extent of our marketing playbook. Good, better, best offerings; building the equity of our iconic brands; world-class marketing; and industry-leading innovation and taking costs out to pay for it all. Where we've done that we've gotten great results. 
In cheese and dairy we ended Q2 gaining share in the total cheese category on a 52-week basis. The first time in a very long time since that's happened. This was led by significantly improved advertising over the past year. And as George Zoghbi described at the CAGNY lunch in June, Philly, Velveeta, Kraft slices, Cracker Barrel and Shredded Cheese are all seeing process and manufacturing changes to drive further renovation of these great brands, and our competitive advantage going forward. Velveeta dinners were up double digits over the prior year, thanks to marketing investment and great innovation. Lunchables was up 10% and continued to innovate with its latest successful launch, Lunchables Uploaded, introducing another rung on the price value ladder, and establishing a range of good, better, best offerings within our Lunchables franchise. 
In beverages we drove a significant improvement in product mix. On-demand coffee has grown since the first quarter introduction of our new Keurig-compatible cups. We increased our offerings in the second quarter. And more innovative SKUs will hit the shelves in the coming weeks. Our new Crystal Light and Kool-Aid water enhancers drove further growth in our beverage mixes business. Distribution gains are on track and consumer poll has been great. And, lastly, our Planters snack nuts turnaround story continues. Planters' share has been up for the last five consecutive four-week periods, after 20 consecutive periods of share decline. Last quarter we talked about the Kool-Aid man's comeback. This time it is another one of our great icons who is taking center stage. Mr. Peanut, our beloved spokesnut for Planters is back, with a new voice, a new creative, that launched just after the quarter ended to support our newest nut-rition products. Great momentum for a great jewel in our portfolio. And there's more to come from Mr. Peanut. Hey, if you can't get excited about Mr. Peanut in this business, you can't get excited about anything. 
Now, across our portfolio we held or grew market share in more than half of our revenue base during the first six months of the year. And our shares continued to strengthen as we advanced through the second quarter, but it is not enough to simply grow market share. We have an obligation to our customers to drive volume and category growth. The fact is, in the second quarter, consumption weakness and competitive activity in several categories worked to offset the strong growth we saw in the rest of the portfolio. Our pourable and spoonable dressing categories were down significantly, primarily due to aggressive discounting and merchandising by our competitors. In cold cuts, we're working to stabilize share and revenue losses through a strategy that includes better price-sized architecture, and shifting marketing across our good, better, best lineup. 
Crystal Light powdered beverage mixes were down, primarily due to cannibalization from our own liquid water enhancers, and price-based competition from other powdered players. And JELL-O is down again in the quarter because we hadn't progressed the marketing proposition to a point where it justified our big bet investment levels. Now, could we have done more in these areas to prop up volume and sales performance in the quarter? Absolutely. But if a promotion didn't meet our profitability hurdles, or our long-term business objectives, we held back. If a campaign wasn't ready for prime time, we held back. This is the discipline of focusing on profitable growth. In fact, our promotion levels were down 8% versus the second quarter of last year, compared to a 1.2% decline for the entire industry. 
The bottom line is this. We are not yet firing on all cylinders in terms of brand-building marketing and promotional programs. And we are still not at share of voice, share of market, benchmark advertising levels, behind a number of our biggest brands. We have more to do, and more to do consistently across all our categories. But we are making progress. And we would be in second half with share momentum from a stronger base. We have a more robust slate of programs and innovation in place, across more categories than we have had in a long time. For instance, in our grocery business alone, roughly two-thirds of our brands will have on-air support, with a 30% increase in advertising versus the prior year. We fully expect these initiatives over the back half will drive greater profitable revenue growth, and address some of the softness we saw in certain categories in the first half of the year. At the same time, we're making excellent progress in lowering our costs through Lean Six Sigma and overhead reductions as well as strengthening our talents. 
Let me turn it over to Tim to talk about the cost side of the equation in quarter two. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Tony. I'm very pleased to say we're making great progress on the cost side. Our relentless drive for efficiency and cost savings continued to show through in our second quarter results. We were up against exceptional profitability in the year-ago period when several of our businesses were either benefiting from pricing catching up to input costs, or were not yet spending strongly against their brands. So, excluding the impact from post-employment programs, which I'll discuss later, our operating profit dollars were down versus very strong prior-year results. 
Nonetheless, we're on track, if not ahead, of our full-year plan, in terms of profitability. And we're delivering the fuel to reinvest in our business. Through the first six months of the year, productivity paced above our 2.5% long-term target, and led to very healthy gross profit dollars and margin in the quarter. A good portion of this was due to the timing of productivity gains versus the timing of line investments to drive innovation that will materialize in the back half of the year. Even so, this gives us greater confidence in hitting that part of our growth algorithm for the year. 
At the overhead line, savings continued to come through and tracked favorably to the prior year. And we will hold full-year overhead costs flat to down from the prior year. That's better than our previous expectation that our cost reductions this year would not fully cover synergies from becoming a standalone company. But while our cost savings programs are on track, we need to strike a better balance between savings and reinvestment going forward. Our challenge is to ensure that we're well positioned to more quickly translate savings into investments that will drive our business. 
Let me turn it back to Tony to build on that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Tim. I can't emphasize enough that a critical part of that investment is our people. And we've made significant progress on several fronts. The first is recruiting. This has been our biggest recruiting year ever. We are selectively and aggressively hiring across the new Kraft, in part as we fill vacancies by employees opting into our early retirement program, or creating new roles that reflect our key priorities. The second is training and building important capabilities. Kraft University is open for enrollment. Our Chief Marketing Officer, Deanie Elsner's organization, has also created its Marketing Center of Excellence, providing a lean core of deep expertise that will help us strengthen our marketing muscle, unleashing the power of our brands and our brand managers. And in our performance-first culture, our brand teams, and all of our key leaders, will be rewarded commensurate with their ability to drive profitable growth. 
Third, we're ensuring our organizational structure brings out the best in our people, allowing greater focus and reducing complexity. This quarter we're dividing our grocery business unit into two new units, creating simpler structures that bring together similar brands and categories. Focus and simplified decision-making are critical in today's world of real-time marketing and the ongoing reinvention of our brands. And, last, we continue to build a winning, inclusive and collaborative culture. We are on track to complete the transformation of our Kraft Town Campus by the end of this year, creating an open work space. But it is not just about the physical work space. It is how we bring our people together through the culture we create. 
Kraft was just recognized for the fourth year in a row by DiversityInc, for creating an inclusive and diverse environment that brings in unique perspective. Which, in turn, drives innovation and ideas that reflect and connect with the customers and consumers we serve. And, finally, we have created a new community, with career paths for military personnel looking to transition from serving their country to civilian life. We were honored to be named to the Military Times' 2013 Best Places For Vets list. 
In sum, our talent strategy can be captured in nine words. Recruit the best, grow the best, reward the best. These efforts touch all corners of our organization, from marketing, to functions like finance, supply chain and R&D. And you'll hear more about what we're doing in these areas in the coming months. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So now let's move on to our EPS results which, for the second quarter, were $1.38, up from $1.02 last year. There are two factors I'd like to highlight here. The first is the non-cash benefit of $0.62 per share for market-based impacts to our post-employment benefit plans. When we announced our new post-employment benefit strategy last year, we indicated that we would make an annual mark-to-market true-up in the fourth quarter each year. So why are we reporting the impact now? Earlier this year we initiated a voluntary early retirement program. The result of that program triggered a remeasurement of two of our largest pension plans. And the impact of that remeasurement reflected higher discount rates and asset values. Given the significance of this impact, we were required to record these results this quarter. And, for the same reasons, we will be remeasuring again in the third quarter. Unfortunately, there is no way to reasonably predict future impacts, so we have assumed no additional resultant change in our 2013 guidance update. 
Back to our Q2 results and the second factor to note. As anticipated, and as we highlighted in our first-quarter call, our earnings from operations in the second quarter were lower than in the prior year. Down $0.10 when compared to the exceptional level of profitability that occurred in the second quarter of 2012. Nonetheless, while we face a difficult comparison in Q2, we were still up nicely on a year-to-date basis. And, in fact, a bit ahead of the pacing we expected in our full-year guidance. To that end, I'll turn it back to Tony to begin our update on guidance for the year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Tim. On the top line we recognized that our organic net revenue growth may finish the year slightly below our original forecast. While we expect our second-half growth will outpace the market, we anticipate that our focus on profitable growth, and a slower-than-anticipated Q2, will mean that our total organic net revenues may trail overall North American food and beverage growth for the full year. And that includes the extraordinary product pruning we've talked about before, which will impact our top line by about 1 point this year, but should not be a factor beyond 2013. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're also updating our EPS guidance. As you saw in our second-quarter results, savings are pacing slightly ahead of plan. We also anticipate favorability at the tax line, with an effective tax rate for the full year of about 34% versus 35% expected previously. However, we will spend back some of that upside. One of the areas will be restructuring. We expect to complete most, if not all, of our restructuring program this year. Total restructuring program costs in 2013 are expected to be approximately $325 million, versus the $300 million expected previously. We'll also use some of the favorability to reinvest into brand building. 
As a result we're increasing our guidance from approximately $2.75 a share to approximately $3.40 a share. This reflects the $0.62 non-cash benefit from the market based impacts to our post-employment benefit plans I discussed earlier, as well as some upside from operations and our tax rate. We're also pacing to deliver free cash flow at a greater-than-expected level this year -- about $1.2 billion compared to previous guidance of approximately $1 billion. The upside to our free cash flow expectations is driven by strong working capital management and CapEx efficiency. Overall our organization is embracing and will continue to embrace cash-driven return-focused decision-making. I would also point out that we're on track with our $600 million pension contribution, roughly two-thirds of which has already been made. And is reflected in the $399 million first-half free cash flow we just reported. 
Before we go to Q&A, one final note on what you can expect in our reporting going forward. As Tony mentioned, we're creating two standalone business units by dividing the brands in our grocery segment. Our third-quarter results will report these business units as distinct reportable segments. In addition, we will begin reporting Canada results separately from what we are calling our other businesses -- exports and food service. We will provide you with a historical break-out for our new segment structure before the end of the third quarter. Now, I'll turn things back over to Tony for a few final remarks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Tim. As I said at the outset, we are making meaningful progress on our plans, with a mission to deliver long-term profitable growth and strong free cash flow. We're focused and taking the right steps to build our brands, our people, and our capabilities. 
And now we'd love to take your questions.

Good evening, everybody. Tony, you mentioned a certain weakness in your salad dressings. Is that just more comparative activity? Or is there also a shift to refrigerated salad dressings, away from the shelf-stable product that you have? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I think when it comes to salad dressings we're talking about a business that really is in the midst of a lot of competitive Armageddon activity. You've got five or six big players. You've got two that are rumored to be for sale or are for sale. You're seeing significant promotion, 10 for 10, in merchandising and pricing. 
And, frankly, we're electing not to go deep in play. You've seen we've done some good things with our Italian dressing line and Mr. Zesty. We are doing some promotion but we're not going for the 10 for 10 level. And probably we're going to ride this out until we have all elements of our program ready to go, and let the marketplace battle it out for a while. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pila Reed,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, really no shift from the center of the store to the refrigerated aisle, that you can see? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not that is significant at this point. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pila Reed,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then mac and cheese seems to become much more crowded. Obviously Kraft has a fantastic brand there with the Kraft brand. How do you stay ahead of this increased competitive activity there, though? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mac and cheese is center of the plate for Kraft, and probably one of our most important franchises. We have formidable foes. And some of the bigger players are getting into this with some of the entrants. We'll continue to battle. And I think we've demonstrated that there is a rising tide because this category is especially well positioned in the recession. You actually can feed your family well with what we offer and what some of the competitors offer. So I'm looking for some real category growth, and I think we'll defend ourselves nicely. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pila Reed,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wouldn't you be the one, though, that everybody goes after for market share? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, we saw this when one of those companies up North with a great brand name came after us. And we probably had one of our best years ever in the face of real competition. I think great competition can bring out the greatness in great brands, and deliver category growth to our customers. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pila Reed,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right. I appreciate it. Thank you.

Bryan Spillane from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [12]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi, good afternoon. A couple of questions just related to the guidance. First, correct me if I'm remembering this wrong, but beginning next year you're actually not going to give any forward guidance. Is that correct? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That is correct, Bryan, yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. So when we're looking at how to treat the mark-to-market gain -- so, the guidance now, including that, is $3.40. But we're not going to have any guidance for next year, so should we be thinking about that being the base to use to apply the algorithm to? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, Bryan. We didn't envision, quite frankly, at the time we set our growth algorithm in place that we were actually going to go to mark-to-market accounting, or that it would have such a material impact. Again, I will remind you, that is a non-cash impact. And our growth algorithm does not include it. 
So, how I would suggest you think about next year is, I would strip out the impact of the mark-to-market, whether it be in the second quarter, what may transpire in the third quarter, and then any true-up we will do in the fourth quarter of this year, as the base operational foundation. I would suggest that -- we have said that this year we're going to have $325 million of restructuring. But we would scale that back to about $125 million in an ongoing basis as we move forward. So I would add that to the base guidance and then apply the growth we've identified. Which is, from an OI standpoint, mid to upper single digits, and from an EPS standpoint, mid single digits. So that's how I would suggest you think about it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. So we'd be using a base now of, instead, $2.75, it's gone up to $2.78, as we're starting to think about how we grow next year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's correct. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And, Bryan, a clarification. It's mid single digit at the OI level, and then mid to high at the EPS as a long-term growth algorithm. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I got it backwards. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then just one last question related to it. If we look at the first half of this year, I think at the beginning of the year we had guidance of $2.75, and we were assuming -- I think the assumption was it would be split evenly 50-50 between the first half and the second half. I think that's what you said on the first-quarter earnings call. Right now you're running about $0.14 ahead of that plan. And I guess you're going to spend about $25 million back on extra restructuring. So does it leave us with about $80 million or $90 million more of marketing spend for the year? 
I'm just trying to understand how much more incremental spending there will be in the second half versus what your original budget was. Because it seems like, understanding there's some phasing issues, but it seems like you're running pretty far ahead of what your original plan was for the first half. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A couple thing I would suggest, Bryan, is that some of the -- we started off, and we go back to the old big Kraft in North America, we had a 48%-52% split first half-second half. As we get further in, we're still learning about the nature of our markets and so forth, as we pull out the biscuit piece of it. That we become much more of an Easter-driven seasonality than historically, with biscuits of a Christmas distortion on there. So our balance is probably a little bit mid-50s first half, mid-40s second half, as we think about it on an ongoing basis. And I think that is probably reflected, if you go back into the carve-out statements for 2012, and even what you might carve out for 2011. So think about it a little bit that way. 
As I pointed out, our first half we saw very strong productivity come through. We drove the cost savings on the overhead line. And we just didn't -- employing our disciplined approach to not investing until we're ready. So we had a more favorable first half. As we go into the second half, and you really can't go into the specifics of how much we're going to spend, but directionally, you're right. There is $25 million higher restructuring costs that we're going to incur this year. And then we will be more heavying up on some of the advertising to drive our improvement going forward. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [22]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All right. That's very helpful. Thanks, Tim.

John Bumgarner from Wells Fargo. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John Bumgarner,  Wells Fargo Securities - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon. Tony, looking at the Cold Cut business, the sliced lunch meat category volumes are weak. Oscar Mayer has lost share there for about five quarters now, seven quarters in hot dogs. Can you just walk through the drivers of the overall lunch meat category weakness? And then for Oscar Mayer, specifically, what needs to be done there to stabilize that business? Is it better innovation? Is it more targeted price points? Just how are you thinking about that business going forward? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, good question. Cold cuts remains a pitched battle, and the category, honestly, is soft. The better deli fresh segment is seeing some consumers trading down to good, and some consumers are trading back to the deli counter, as deli suppliers are bringing product news and new flavors, and aggressively sampling, after a few years of decline. 
It is interesting, if you look back several years we, the Hillshires and the Oscars and the others, stole share from the deli counter for years. And the balance of share went 4 or 5 points the other way. They're now coming back with some great innovations, stealing some of it back. I do think we know a lot about this consumer. And, frankly, they buy both products -- deli and the process. 
We see our trends improving. In fact, I've got to give credit to my Oscar Mayer team. For five years they grew cold cut share until the middle of last year -- five years. Then they lost 14% in consumption in fourth quarter versus year ago on the strength of a very good launch from a formidable foe. We cut that in half in the first quarter, and we cut that decline in half again in the second quarter. 
So we see trends improving. You're going to see us respond to the possibilities of this deli-plus-process consumer looking for innovation. And I feel very good about what Oscar has got coming. I think on hotdog, by the way, just to cover hotdogs quickly, I think the share results are a little better than what you laid out. But we got a lot of good hotdog offerings with our select line and with the full-test Oscar line. So I feel good we're going to compete. And now that barbecue season is upon us, and things are going our way in terms of barbecue occasions, I think we've got some nice momentum.

Andrew Lazar from Barclays. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good evening, everyone. Tony, you mentioned in the slides that Kraft under-performed the marketplace on organic sales by about 1.3 percentage points through the first half. If you had to estimate, even roughly, what portion of that was due to the Company proactively pulling back on promotions that you deemed had a poor pay-back, versus where you just got out-gamed in terms of innovation, or what have you, how do you think that would look? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, it's a good question. And, you know what? I don't have a good estimate for you how to break it out. I would tell you this. We didn't have Planters on the air. We didn't have JELL-O on the air. We weren't supporting our enhancers and salad dressing business until we had the 4Ms line up. I tend to feel that all of this is in our control. 
And until we grow our categories above food and beverage peers, we will not be satisfied. Until we consistently grow our volume, which we owe our customers, we won't be satisfied. So, if I'm giving you the short answer, I think this is all in our control. And we can turn this around as we get 15 out of the 60 brands that are spending in share of voice-share market, up to a number that's significantly more than that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then how do you balance the share loss with the profitability metric? It is often said that it can cost twice as much to gain share back versus if you had paid up, up front, to keep it in the first place. So how much of the share loss is Kraft, for lack of a better term, okay with losing, even though I don't think you like, obviously, losing share? It's not really ever okay. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [31]

I'm going to say this. I feel pretty good about our share trends. In fact, if you look at the last 13 weeks and the trends on the year-to-date, we're growing in more than 50% of our categories for the first time in a long time. It's all about the categories, Andrew. We got to grow these categories. We are the category. We have to grow volume in them. When you see what we do in cheese and meals and Lunchables, I believe that playbook can work in our other big categories.

Ken Goldman,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [34]

Hi, thanks for the question. One for Tony and one for Tim. Tony, as you plan to spend more on advertising in the back half, how should we think about which segments might get the lion's share of that spending? And then, Tim, as you boost your guidance for the impact of restructuring this year, are you also lowering your guidance for that impact of restructuring for 2014? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. I'll take the first one, Ken, and I'll give Tim the tougher one. I mentioned several areas where we're focusing. You're going to see Mr. Peanut going to town. You're going to see JELL-O come in with its first big campaign in many years. We got the salad dressing and mayonnaise wars with good, better, best pricing, and better advertising. So I think you'll see focus there as the year goes on. Those categories are billion-dollar categories for Kraft. And those are the four I'd call out. There are more, but those are four that you're going to see us working hard to execute the playbook against. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Goldman,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then before Tim jumps in, does that imply, perhaps, a little bit of a lighter margin for grocery in the back half of the year? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [37]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think so. I always talk about the wind at our back of this productivity we've got in our pocket as it improves. And I'm not going to -- we're not going to be slaves to that margin percent, as your friend Chris Jakubiak always tells you. It's about money we take to the bank. But as we grow those businesses, I think those are pretty nice profitable brands. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll respond to your second question, Ken. We said that we're going to complete the existing outstanding $650 million program a bit earlier than we anticipated. So, the spending we had expected to drill in a little bit into 2014, but we're going to accelerate and get it done in 2013. We have identified in the past that, on an ongoing basis, embedded within our results we would expect to see $125 million. But that is included in the algorithm that we talked about earlier. 
So, whatever additional restructuring, there may be a little bit of carryover, but I would expect it largely to be embedded within the $125 million. The base algorithm we've talked about should work. And, as Bryan asked earlier, if you adjust the base to strip out the one-time mark-to-market and also the restructuring pieces, you'd get a good foundation on which to apply our growth algorithm.

Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I'm looking forward to seeing Mr. Peanut back on the big stage. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Way to go, Jason. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jason English,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I wanted to focus on a question of the cash flow, so this is directed to Tim. A few questions, and I'll just throw them together and you can address them as you see fit. First, you mentioned CapEx efficiency. Can you update us on what you are expecting for CapEx for the full year, at least the CapEx line? What is the cash portion of the higher restructuring charge? And then, also, working capital -- to get to your cash from operations guidance suggests pretty heroic inflows on working capital. Can you give us more detail on the initiatives you're driving to free up all that cash? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [44]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure. The first thing is restructuring tends to be about -- 50% of what we're expensing tends to be cash. The other tends to be balance sheet write-offs, et cetera. Our full-year expectation for this year, including a component that's going into restructuring, is about $650 million. That obviously goes down as we finish the restructuring program to a 2.5% or so level. And the third question was? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jason English,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [45]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Working capital -- if you could give us some details on that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [46]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A couple of things. We work very hard. I'm always happy to talk about working capital and cash flows. And I'm particularly pleased to say that a lot of the cash, and working capital, particularly, is coming from our inventories. I always consider it coming out of receivables. I'd rather as I say have it in my pocket than my customer's. But on the flip side it tends to become a zero sum game. 
When we talk about inventory, streamlining, getting better at forecasting, bringing SKU rationalization, getting better at the forecasting side of it, it all helps us continue to keep our service levels high, and still bring our inventory levels down. And that's, I would say, where the majority of our benefit has come here to date. And I still think that we have plenty to go as we look forward. 
We are coming up to the back-to-school, and I expect that I'm going to be talking a fair amount. Bob Gorski, our Vice President of Operations, is going to be there and share a lot of the productivity and operations improvements that we have in the pipeline, that we've accomplished. And we'll be talking a lot more about how that relates to our working capital and our cash flow initiatives, as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Feeney,  Janney Montgomery Scott - Analyst    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony, you mentioned promotional activities specifically in dressings. And I think across the board a lot of food companies are talking about promotional activity among competitors driving a little bit worse than expected volume. I wonder, is it possible that lower price points are what are needed to drive volume in some of these categories? And, if not, which I assume that as a category leader, everything you said, obviously the best case is that it is not what needs to happen. What analytics do you have, what data do you have, to suggest that that is the case -- that you're at the right price point, and really what is needed is innovation, et cetera, those things that you have been driving to drive these categories? Thanks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I do think the temptation is to reinstate promo to boost sales. We're not going to do it. We'll remain focused on profitable, sustainable growth. You may see us use some promotion to adjust a price point for commodity costs. For instance, Philly. But we'll do it with an eye towards profitability and brand health. 
And I think the cheese franchise is a great example of when it works, man, it works. Who would have thought that a couple years ago in cheese? We're confident we can provide value at every rung in the pricing ladder. We do think uniquely our net productivity and cost savings is an enabler, and gives us the flexibility we need when we do encounter some irrational behavior. But I'm not going to make the mistake I made on last quarter's call and lead you to believe that I'm going to participate in big price wars, because we're not. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Feeney,  Janney Montgomery Scott - Analyst    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just as a follow-up, Tony, where you have participated -- not participated in price wars, but where you have, in a targeted way, adjusted a price point, has that driven volume? Is that response above average, or below average, from your experience in the industry? How price-sensitive is that consumer out there? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan, I think it is category-dependent. I do think the whole bundle is what matters. And I do think that the reason we continue to talk about good, better, best pricing, it is how you deliver the whole bundle, including innovation and advertising. So, yes, of course, I'm going to sell more Philly at holidays with a lower price point when commodities are in my favor. But we lead that category with a 65 market share. And I think we're doing that in a profitable way when we lead those calls. We've got very good analytics to help us make that decision. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We don't want to let the price-value proposition get out of alignment. But, on the flip side, we believe that we are very capable and much better served to focus on delivering more value rather than dropping the price. So that's where innovation and good, better, best comes in, et cetera. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Zaslow,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [56]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony, you always said that you don't want to invest until you get the right cost structure right. And I know six months ago you were not there on the Planters. So, my question is, what did you do differently on the Planters to get the cost structure right? And what other businesses are on the cusp of getting to the right cost algorithm that you can invest back into? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, great question. Keep in mind, I hope what I've said is that we don't invest until margin, materiality, momentum and message are aligned. So it's not just cost. In fact, that is just one of the pieces. But I will tell you, and I bless my lucky stars, right place, right time. 
We've got Lean Six Sigma, integrated business management, end-to-end cost effort, cash is king, overhead is reduced by 30%-plus in the last two years. We have very good favorability, generally across all of our businesses, on the cost side, on the margin side -- not talking margin percent. So, it comes down to message and materiality and momentum, when you see the cost side doing well. 
And, frankly, Planters, I think you guys have called this right in your models, the costs have improved significantly. We were waiting for Mr. Peanut's message to be right. And it is. And so we're going after it. And it's really the stars align when the 4Ms are aligned. Did that answer it, Ken? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Zaslow,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It did. And then what are the -- because I know JELL-O seems to -- my sense is you probably got that fixed to the right alignment. What are the other businesses that are on the cusp of getting to the right level that you can start advertising behind and moving more aggressively on the top line on? I sense there's probably at least three to five other businesses that are still -- levers have not been pulled on advertising new product, yet. So, which ones do you think are on the cusp? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can go down our list of $500 million-plus brands and figure out the ones that have been milked for years. I'm not going to get into specifics other than what I told you. And, obviously, Planters, JELL-O, I called out salad dressing and enhancers is something we got to fix. So, those would be the ones that we've been public about with you and the trade. I probably won't go beyond that for competitive reasons.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Moskow,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. I wanted to know, Tony, I looked through the write-up and I saw positive mix highlighted for beverages and, I think, cheese. But not so for refrigerated meals and grocery. And my thinking on Kraft is that this is one of the things that is changing for the better, is that you're emphasizing products that have better mix profile and better margin profile, as long as they have good business momentum. I just want to know, in refrigerated meals, wouldn't Lunchables strength be a positive to your mix in refrigerated? And then in grocery, maybe the opposite is true, with Planters getting the growth and Spoonables and Pourables not. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good question, Rob. For us, you're right. And I think your assumption is right and the model assumption is right. Year-to-date vol mix is up, and volume is up. And second quarter it was down. But year-to-date it is positive. And, by the way, I think that's somewhat unique in our business, but something we all have to achieve for our customers and our business in the long term. 
Growing volume is critical and improving vol mix. Now, it is not up at the levels that I'm going to need to deliver growth faster than my markets and key competitors, but it is positive trend up versus other years. And in the two businesses you cite, Lunchables is definitely a positive vol mix story. Oscar in total, I think for the first half of the year is plus or minus. But some of it has to do with just this deli business is so big. That deli business is $2 billion of our Oscar franchise. And it was down because of the issues we've talked about. I think you're going to see that improve as we go forward with the battle plan. 
I think you also mentioned grocery. There was a lot of grocery benefit to Easter. So you pull forward stuff in the first quarter, and we gave back some of that volume gain in second quarter. In general, I think grocery had a slightly positive vol mix in first half. So, I wouldn't get too hung up on 13 weeks but I would tell you our long-term goal is to do exactly what you're describing. And I hope you'll hold me to it, because that is what I hold my teams to. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Moskow,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And just a quick follow-up for Tim. Looking at the SG&A in the quarter on an adjusted basis, $789 million, that's up like $150 million from SG&A in the first quarter. I'm trying to model out SG&A. How much of that step-up is the new cost structure being apart from Mondelez? And how much of it is just a seasonal increase from first to second? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think there is a lot of seasonal increase. How I think about it is, the standalone, what we call dis-synergies, is somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million a year. And that was pretty much reflected in the first quarter, as it was in the second quarter. So there really wasn't an impact on that. There really isn't much, if any, seasonal impact. The biggest piece you see embedded within there is advertising. It was up appreciably from last year and up appreciably from the first quarter. That is most, if not all, and maybe even more than all, of the quarter-on-quarter impact you're seeing. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Moskow,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [66]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's an enormous increase in advertising, if that is really what the driver is. And I know you're saying you're a little disappointed in the sales in the quarter, Tony, but how disappointed are you? Like 2%, 3%? How disappointing was it? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [67]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, I would say that you don't look to advertising to deliver a return in a quarter. I've never seen it, frankly. And these are very responsive brands. But I'm going to tell you, until we grow, as we told you our objective, consistently, our categories above our food and beverage peers, we won't be satisfied. And until we grow our volume above our food and beverage peers, and deliver to our customers volume growth, we won't be satisfied. I do think investing in advertising is the best thing Kraft can do in the long term. 
Keep in mind, I'm still $0.60 on the dollar versus the competitors we've targeted as the benchmark. So, double-digit ad growth is what we're going to need to get that thing going in the long term. And to deliver against a share of spend, share of market goal, that we have for our key categories. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And, Rob, I think just one thing I'd add there. When you look at it on a year-over-year basis, just simply in the second quarter, advertising was up double digits in Q2, but that was versus a relatively lower level of support the prior year. And, as Tony said, we plan to make progress on the share of voice versus share of market this year, and frankly that is what it's going to take. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good evening. Can I follow up on that question that Rob asked in relation to advertising being up? Certainly SG&A was up. Certainly if you look, excluding charges, up quite a bit year over year. And there is also a comment very early on in the press release about brand investments being held back by a return discipline. So I wanted to try to foot those two comments. I see that advertising is up because SG&A is up so much. But what did that comment refer to then in relation to brand investments? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It refers to the discipline -- well, first, let's face it, we're over-delivering in some other key measures, right? And could we have spent more and would I have wanted to, Chris? Of course I would. But I didn't have specifically the JELL-O advertising ready. I do now. You're going to see it pretty quick. And I didn't have Planters done. Now you will. So, some of it is holding back until we get the test results and we're convinced that it's going to work on our 4Ms. 
Now that said, we grew advertising at low double digits. I think we're one of the few people in our business continuing to grow advertising at double digits. But, remember, look where we started. We're still $0.60 on the dollar versus competitors. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. You're seeing significant growth, but we still have a long ways to go. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And so you expect an increase in advertising in the second half of the year, given your first half over-delivery, and some of these programs being ready. So, it sounds like your full-year run rate of advertising would run even ahead of the first half level of advertising? Because I think it was up double digit in Q1, as well. Is that correct? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - IR    [75]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris, what you're talking about is really -- it is a matter of what we're doing this year but it's also a matter of what happened last year. And last year, the step-up in advertising really happened in the second half. So, if you think about percentage increases and whatnot, it may not be as strong in the second half of this year versus what you saw in the first half of this year. But that's really more a matter of comparisons as opposed to what the flow is this year. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [76]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dollars actually step up in the back half, but percentage growth from the prior year will actually be lower. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can I ask about cash flow? I think you mentioned that CapEx may be part of the reason for the cash flow coming through more slowly than expected. Is that reduction in CapEx a one-time thing for this year? Or is that likely to be a structural change that will go forward? And can you give us an updated CapEx number for the year? And then the link to that, what are you planning to do with the extra cash as it comes through? Would that be used for share repurchases, or other items? Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We had anticipated $650 million, or thereabouts, including a step-up for some of the restructuring spend that we're spending this year. Again, that will go down in subsequent years. I would say we're being more disciplined on projects. We are accommodating the growth where there's necessary. We're accommodating where we have productivity and efficiency improvements and it requires CapEx. We're maintaining our facilities, et cetera. We're just doing it a bit smarter and getting more out of the dollars we're spending. So, I expect maybe we'll come into the year a little bit better than that, but we're not materially changing our guidance at this point. I think there is a -- I take that back. Embedded within the step-up -- the stepped up extra $200 million worth of cash flow in our updated forecast, I think there is, I don't know, $50 million worth of improvement in lower CapEx spending. 
And when it comes to what are we doing with it? We need to maintain a strong, healthy balance sheet. There are agencies. You may have noted that S&P has removed the negative outlook from our rating. But I would still say that our metrics are not quite what the agencies would look for to be fully reflective of our ratings. We've said before, and we'll stand behind -- what we've said is, we'll stock rank investment opportunities, whether it be investing back in our Business, whether it be looking at acquisitions, whether it be looking at share repurchase or increased dividends. Those are all good uses of cash. But we'll stock rank those opportunities and work down the list with the highest risk-adjusted return as the primary consideration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First off, I want to say that your calls are the most entertaining calls that we get. Tony, nice job in really demonstrating everything that's good about brands in how you present to us. I want to just simply say that when I look at the first two quarters in the $0.22 beat, the first thing that strikes me, and I think it does a lot of clients, is that it feels like the earnings should be like $2.90 to $3. 
But I think in the answer to Growe's question, and Spillane's question, I think what you guys are seeing is that -- and I want to try it this way -- advertising as a percentage of sales in the first half, it had to go up a lot, but it is still just not where it needs to be. And the reason why the guidance doesn't go up to like $3, given this first-half beat, is because you really do need a very sizeable step-up as a percentage of sales. Tony, am I hearing you right on this? And is that how the algorithm works on the year? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [84]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David, let me first thank you for the compliment. I think you're buttering us up because your question is one that Chris Jakubiak won't let me give you a target. But I still take the compliment. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [85]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to remind everybody, we're building this Company for the long term and to get to sustainable top tier returns over that long term. We're on track. We're very focused on delivering our guidance for the year. We're very focused on setting up for the growth algorithm so that we can sustainably continue to grow our earnings and our top line. 
We need to continue to invest back in our brands to make sure we have innovation, make sure that they're getting adequate brand support. And I will remind you, this year was a little bit unusual. I'm always very pleased to see the cost savings come in, because they're usually the toughest ones to go at. And we had very good productivity from our operations and manufacturing folks. And Bob Gorski is going to tell you a lot more about that at back-to-school. 
We did a good job of managing our overheads, as we talked about earlier. And some of those savings just got ahead of our ability to effectively invest back into the brands. But, as we get to the back half, yes, we need to get to a level that is consistent with the share of voice-share market rate. And we need to get the benchmark industry against vis-a-vis our competitors to make sure that we have good, healthy brands. So, yes, you'll see that stepped up in the back half of the year to flesh out the algorithm. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Driscoll,  Citi Research - Analyst    [86]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fundamentally, that is what makes the guidance not go to a $3 number, because this is a discretionary issue on advertising spend. Correct? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CEO    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One thing I'd add. I think Tim said it well. But I think anyone looking for EPS greater than our guidance will find that our forecast accuracy is better on a full-year basis than it has been on quarterly pacing. You combine that with the fact -- David, this is why I always talk about people. 
We need great marketers to generate great advertising, so that Tim McLevish sitting in the ROI meetings with me says -- that test result and that ad deserves to get your investment. And that affects pacing in a big way. I should have had Planters six months ago. I am thrilled I got it now. I should have had JELL-O a year ago. But it takes time to develop great advertising.

Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [90]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let me first ask Tim on inflation, or deflation, as the case may be. I don't think you talked about that. Can you say how that affected the second quarter? And then what you're thinking about for the second half. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I'll remind you, Eric, we're very focused, particularly the categories in which they tend to be much more dependent upon single commodities, on focusing on up where we call pricing net of cost. And I think we did a pretty effective job in the first half of the second quarter on managing to PNOC. Actually, I think first half we were a little bit under water. But you don't get that phasing and pacing just precise. But we're a little bit under water there. What we saw -- and I'm not going to forecast the future, we're much better, as I said, at managing the impact of our input costs than we are on forecasting them. 
But you saw in the second quarter, you saw a lot of the meat prices go up. And that is the residual effect from some of the grain runs-up late last year. You saw barrel cheese going up a little bit. You saw some of the grains, the wheats and flour, go up. You saw coffee come down. And the nuts, generally, were in a down trend. 
Energy was a bit mixed. Natural gas on its way down and diesel on its way up. That is what we saw in the second quarter. But I think the most important thing is, with the exception of perhaps being modestly under water for the quarter, I think we did a pretty good job of managing the pricing net of cost. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [92]

Okay. I realize it's maybe a little premature, but in terms of just listening to your responses to those people who are including the restructuring charges, you have a 6% to 7% tail wind, on the way you're presenting the business for next year, just on the drop in restructuring. And you're talking about if your productivity programs stay as strong as you expect them to, you basically, it sounds like you just, again, to make your target and your growth objectives, you have basically a lot of flexibility to spend all of that productivity back into advertising, and then some. Is that a fair way to characterize how you see 2014 shaping up on the EBIT levers?

I would go back to the basic themes within our growth algorithm. Again, you're right. We would expect -- yes, there is some tail wind by the step down in restructuring from 2013 to '14/. We've indicated that we would expect that reduction to be baked into the base from which we would expect our mid to high single digit EPS growth. And that growth is reflective of growing at our categories, generating margin dollars with our PNOC discipline. 
And, yes, continuing our journey to get to fully support our brands with share of market share voice, a benchmark advertising level, which we're still sitting at $0.60 or $0.70 on the dollar. So we have a ways to go back there. And so, yes, to the extent we get the 4 or 5 Ms aligned, we would expect that we would continue. We think that's probably the highest and best use of our available cash and earnings, is to reinvest back in our brands. So we would expect to bring it in along those lines, consistent with all of that algorithm. And what we do generate in addition we would look to be investing back.

Diane Geissler,  CLSA - Analyst    [96]

Thanks for the question. I think it's actually been answered with your commentary to Eric, just here on your change in restructuring. I have it at around $0.22. Does that sound about right? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - IR    [97]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diane, what we're looking at, we just updated the spending on restructuring in 2013 to be at $325 million. And we've said that ongoing we expect to spend about $125 million on cost savings initiatives. That certainly still holds. We've said before we expect to deliver against our long-term growth algorithm after 2013. That is still the case. And we'll also have the benefit of the lower spending on cost saving initiatives in 2013. No other exceptional factors, that we know at this time. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group, Inc. - CFO    [98]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. The $200 million delta in restructuring year on year, though, would result in approximately $0.22. You're about right, Diane. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diane Geissler,  CLSA - Analyst    [99]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, I just wanted to clarify. Thank you.
