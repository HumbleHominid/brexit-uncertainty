Operator    [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Kraft Foods Group Inc reports third-quarter results conference call. 
(Operator Instructions) 
As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Chris Jakubik, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - VP, IR    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good afternoon, and thanks for joining our quarterly business update. As usual, Tony Vernon, our CEO; and Tim McLevish, our CFO, are with us today as well. 
During our remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties. These are discussed in our press release and Form 10-K. 
We will also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our press release and in the Investor Center of KraftFoodsGroup.com. Now I will hand it over to Tony and Tim to discuss our third-quarter (inaudible). 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Chris. And thanks to everyone for joining us to discuss the puts and takes in our business through the third quarter of this year. Before we dive into our usual business update and our take on the dynamics in the past quarter, we thought it best to start today by quickly putting some context around the third-quarter financials we just reported. That is because the atypical nature of last year's results masked the steady progress we are making in rejuvenating the best brand portfolio in food and beverage. 
We have talked before about the extraordinary activities related to our spin-off from Mondelez last year, and the revenue imbalance that affected our reported results in last year's third and fourth quarters. And that imbalance is again impacting our year-over-year comparisons this year. It relates to the unusual but prudent ramp-up of trade inventories we drove at the end of the third quarter last year, and how that compares to what is a more normal pattern this year. But let me turn it over to Tim to explain it more fully. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Tony, and good afternoon. To illustrate how this played out, we prepared a breakdown of the significant revenue drivers in the third quarter. As the chart shows, we experienced a negative impact of vol mix of approximately 3 percentage points. This was due to the comparison with spin-related shipments last year. 
If you recall, we shipped extra product to retailers to build safety stock just ahead of the systems change-over related to our separation from Mondelez last year. Aside from this timing effect, extraordinary pruning also had a negative impact of about 1 point during the quarter. And that is consistent with our previous guidance. 
Excluding those factors, our base business generated roughly 1 point of organic growth from vol mix. In the context of a North American food and beverage industry that saw 0.5 point of volume decline in the third quarter, that's pretty solid performance. 
The chart also shows that this 1 point vol mix gain was essentially offset by a 1-point drag from lower prices. But I would note that the 1-point reduction in pricing included significant adjustments we have made to reflect lower peanut and green coffee input costs, versus the prior year. 
Net-net, it was a relatively solid top line performance that was overshadowed by an unusual set of comparable numbers in the year-ago period. And now I will hand it back to Tony. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Tim. Now let's turn to the more germane discussion of our marketplace and how we are operating in it. First, we have been getting a lot of questions about the state of the consumer. So what have we seen? 
During the third quarter, we witnessed the value consciousness of the consumer intensifying. This looks to be driven by a combination of factors -- a prolonged decline in the labor participation rate. The burden of higher payroll taxes. And continued erosion in consumer confidence. 
We are seeing shopper trips down overall, and especially down in the all-important stock-up trip. In fact, the only places where store traffic was up in the latest 52 weeks were in the club and dollar channels -- amazing. And in the latest 13 weeks, store traffic was up only in dollar channels. 
With fewer trips, and even fewer large shopping trips, we see consumers with little interest or minimal ability to buy more than what they need for a given week. Or sometimes, a given day. And that's translating into a decline in the lift we typically see from the incremental dollar of promotional activity. 
Given this backdrop, we conclude two things. First, this is not an environment that we or our industry can expect to promote our way out of. And second, it reinforces the importance of the Kraft play book -- great marketing, faster industry innovation, good-better-best price value ladders, achieving low-cost producer status, and the critical principle of reinvesting $0.50 of every $1 of cost savings back into our brands and people over time. 
Now, based on those success factors, how are we doing? In a nutshell, we continue to make progress. But we have got lots more work to do. 
So where do we see the signs of improvement? One is market share. Our shares are flat to growing in categories that make up more than 50% of our business. In 2011, we were holding or growing share in only 34% of our businesses. That figure was in the 40%s last year. 
This positive trend reflects applying our play book to our brands one by one with discipline. And having a high rate of success with fewer, bigger, better investments in innovation and marketing. One year ago, I talked about the need to bend the trend in three of our big businesses -- coffee, JELL-O, and Planters. 
In coffee, I told you that we needed to play effectively in all segments. So what have we done? Well, we grew an on-demand with the introduction of Keurig-compatible cups. We went on air to tell our Gevalia quality story, versus the competition in the premium segment. Thanks to those investments, we are now gaining share in all segments of coffee, and the market overall. 
We expect to sell about $100 million of Keurig-compatible cups this year, including some innovative cappuccinos, lattes, macchiatos that our consumers and our customers are giving five-star ratings. And we are doing all this while closing long-standing cost disadvantages versus the category leader. 
Last year, I also talked about restoring Planters to greatness. Well, Mr. Peanut is back. We are driving solid, profitable volume growth through a three-pronged strategy -- great advertising and innovation. A strong branded focus on what many of you would call a commodity -- dry-roasted peanuts. 
And a significantly more efficient supply chain that's delivering higher-quality products and quality returns. And I should add, we have a great, motivated team. 
Okay, now let's turn to JELL-O. As we have talked about in the past, we wanted to be out sooner with a rejuvenation program. But we did not have the right campaign ready. 
An icon like JELL-O deserves a world-class program. And we just launched the first round of our rejuvenation efforts into the marketplace. It's too early to add more color, but we are excited about the potential of contemporizing such an iconic snack brand. 
And where we have momentum, we have kept pushing. The re-invigoration of Lunchables continues. 
Our cheese and dairy team is executing every element of our play book across all of its great cheese and dairy brands. And our Kraft Mac & Cheese and Velveeta dinners have more than held their own in the face of a highly competitive environment. In fact, on a year-to-year basis, each one of these great franchises is delivering strong profitable growth, at least in the mid single-digits, behind great marketing and innovation. 
Now, I've said it before and I will say it again -- there is no such thing as a mature brand, only tired marketers. That being said, the reality is, the percentage of our portfolio that has been rejuvenated is not yet at critical mass to offset the problem areas that remain. As a portfolio Company, we are unlikely to bat 1,000 and have everything moving in the right direction all at once. 
Right now in the US, 6 of our 17 largest franchises don't yet have the fundamentals in place to drive industry-leading profitable growth. And as a result, our composite growth as a Company is still running below the broader North American food and beverage market. 
Now, let me briefly break these six down, and the actions we are taking to improve. First, JELL-O, which was still down significantly in the third quarter. But as I mentioned, we have just launched a new campaign, adjusted our price pack architecture and continue to work on the cost side of the equation to pay for it all. 
Oscar Mayer cold cuts, which we have also talked about in the past. It is improving sequentially, but needs more innovation and strategic pricing to get it back where it needs to be. We have the right team in place to do that. 
Ready-to-drink beverages, where we are actively addressing some packaging issues. Kraft salad dressings and mayonnaise. A recent price-based competition and our focus on profitable volume have held us back from making the level of brand equity investments that can grow the category and our businesses. 
And powdered beverages, particularly Crystal Light, where we underestimated the degree of cannibalization from a very successful MiO platform. Powdered beverages continue to provide a unique consumer proposition. And we need to go back and rebuild support. 
The good news is that we have the firepower to re-invest and turn these businesses around. And that's because our costs savings and per-activity programs are fully on track. 
Now, I'm going to spare you the speech this time, but the gating factors behind rebuilding our portfolio are people and ideas. We continue to build the performance-driven, collaborative culture we set out to create when we launched the new Kraft one year ago. And no culture is built without great talent. That is why becoming the best recruiter, trainer and developer in our industry is critical. 
As I have said before, we are running this as a marathon, not a sprint. We are confident we are on the right track. And we continue to make steady progress. 
Now, let me turn it back to Tim to discuss our Q3 earnings and update our guidance before we take your questions. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Tony. Moving on now to our EPS results, which for the third quarter, were $0.83, up from $0.79 last year. 
There are three factors I'd like to highlight on EPS bridge. The first is the non-cash benefit of $0.18 per share for market-based impacts to our post employment benefit plans. As we discussed on last quarter's call, and is the case again this quarter, the voluntary early retirement program we put in place during the first half of the year triggered an out-of-cycle re-measurement for two of our largest pension plans. 
The impact of that re-measurement reflected higher discount rates and asset values. Given the significance of this impact, we were required to record these results in the quarter. And, as is our normal cycle, we will be re-measuring those plans again in the fourth quarter. But there is no way to predict future impacts, so we have not assumed any further change within the 2013 guidance update I will provide in just a minute. 
The second factor to note is the impact of lower volumes versus the prior year, from the spin-related safety stock build we discussed earlier. As you can see on the slide, the change in earnings from operations was negative $0.02 in the third quarter. But this included a negative impact of approximately $0.04 on a year-over-year basis, due to comparisons with the benefit we received from safety stock shipments last year. Excluding this factor, we continue to see our productivity and overhead savings come through. 
And finally, we experienced a $0.05 headwind year over year, due to significant unrealized gains from hedging activities last year. 
Stepping back, while there were some puts and takes in the quarter, we remain on track with our full-year guidance. And speaking of which, on the top line, we expect our fourth-quarter growth will significantly outpace the market, due to comparisons with an unusually weak fourth quarter last year. However, due to our performance through the first nine months and our continued focus on profitable growth, our full-year organic revenue growth may trail that of the overall North American food and beverage market. And that includes the extraordinary product line pruning of about 1 point we have talked about before. 
At the EPS line, on an underlying basis, we are making no changes to our full-year expectations. However, we are updating our guidance to reflect the additional $0.18 of non-cash benefit from the market-based impacts on our post employment benefit plans I discussed earlier. We now expect to report earnings per share of approximately $3.58, up from approximately $3.40 previously. 
Now, you might have seen the spring cheese recall we announced last week, and wonder what the impact may be on our fourth quarter. As of right now, we believe the impact will be immaterial to our financials, and manageable within the context of the guidance I just laid out. But we are still finalizing our analysis. 
And finally, we are on track to deliver free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. Working capital management and CapEx efficiency continue to deliver for us. And I'm proud that our organization continues to embrace our cash-driven, return-focused decision-making. 
I would also point out that by the end of the third quarter, we had made $600 million of pension contributions we announced a year ago. With that funding, higher discount rates and solid asset performance, I am pleased to report that we ended the third quarter with our pension plans approximately 90% funded. 
Now I'll turn things back over to Tony for a few final remarks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks, Tim. I will close by saying that as tough as the economy may be, and as strapped as our key consumer is, we feel confident we are on the right track. Nobody likes to operate in this type of environment, and we are not yet firing on all cylinders. But make no mistake -- while we are pleased with the real progress we have made in productivity, overheads, costs, cash flow and market share, we will not be satisfied until we consistently grow our portfolio of great brands faster than the food and beverage industry. 
We are focused and taking the right steps to build our brands, our people and our capabilities, with a mission to deliver long-term profitable growth and strong free cash flow. And now, we would love to take your questions.

Questions and Answers

Certainly.

Ken Zaslow, BMO Capital Markets.

Ken Zaslow,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One just housekeeping question, and then a bigger-subject question. The hedges going away, the $0.05 impact -- was that always part of your guidance? Or is that -- operations is actually better by $0.05, you are just not including that in your forward-looking guidance? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actually, the $0.05 is a net year-on-year change. So in fact, it was a large hedge gain within the 2012 period, throughout the fourth quarter. And it was a much smaller piece, so that the decline was $0.05. And that was kind of anticipated. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - VP, IR    [4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Ken, these things tend to even out over time. But we don't really budget in any sort of gain or loss at the beginning of the year, relative to our guidance. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Zaslow,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [5]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I just figured if you are actually implicitly raising your underlying guidance by that $0.05 or not -- it sounds like just a little thing. I just wanted to make sure I understood that part of it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - VP, IR    [6]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, again, the $0.05 is the difference between what happened last year and this year. This year, what you saw in the quarter was really just a $9 million favorability. So it really -- in the grand scheme, it doesn't really impact our guidance or what we expected to earn this year at all. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Zaslow,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. The bigger point, the big question I really, actually wanted to get to is, Tony, can you talk about the cadence to which those fixed brands, that you expect them to start to see a recovery? Which ones you expect to see earlier in the year, and how it's going to play out to the next -- call it 6 months to 18 months? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, thanks, Ken. I think -- to back up bit. I often get asked this in the context of what percent of the portfolio is fixed. And I would put that number at over 40%. It is up -- it's doubled from maybe two years ago. 
I talk a lot about three categories that nobody thought could be fixed. Cheese and dairy is on an incredible role. Coffee -- who would have thunk it? Three segments growing, and a great on-demand entry in a growing category. And now peanuts and Mr. Peanut and Planters driving some great results. 
So we take this one at a time, with discipline. We don't release funds on any project until we see adequate return on investment. 
And I will be honest -- my benchmark is our Canada business, where two-thirds of our businesses and often 70% in a quarter are growing faster than their category in the industry. And it's made for top-tier performance over time. 
We still have a ways to go. We've got lots of brands, we share a voice less than share of market. We were still spending only about $0.65 on the dollar versus peers. But we are taking it one at a time, and I think you are going to see it coming in. It is a marathon, not a sprint. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Zaslow,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [9]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is any of these six brands sooner than later? Is there any clarity that we can actually start to see? As you said, we have seen a couple of these brands move in the right direction. Will any of these -- which ones will we see first, and which ones will we maybe see a little bit later? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [10]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your Nielsens are my Nielsens. And you definitely are seeing it in the same share progress as I am. Each category is different, so I think our MiO Crystal Light challenge is a lot different with the great innovation than taking on a salad dressing category that has a lot of key competitors. 
So we prioritize them based on a return philosophy and whether they meet our hurdles for message, margin, materiality and momentum. And beyond that, it is talking competitively, which I'd rather not do. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Zaslow,  BMO Capital Markets - Analyst    [11]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great. I appreciate it. Thank you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jason English,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [13]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm here, can you hear me? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - VP, IR    [14]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jason English,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [15]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oh, good. I was nervous there for a moment. Some questions on the coffee, which you guys have highlighted the strength of market share. First, tactically, you listed off some purely compatible products that I hadn't heard of before, wasn't aware of, as to some of the varieties. 
Are these new launches that are pending? Or new launches that have recently hit? Or have I just been dismissing them out there? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [16]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, we just launched a line of new cafe-style offerings -- cappuccinos and lattes under the Gevalia brand. Gotten a lot of great customer feedback, and some great distribution. So I don't think you are late, I just think we are getting them out there now. And it is a tribute to an R&D group there really has capabilities across every coffee segment. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jason English,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [17]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sticking on coffee, one thing that surprised me was the deceleration in price, and pretty sharp decline on a one-year, two-year, three-year stack, however you look at it. Especially since there hasn't been really any announcements of any of the price cuts. Is this decline driven by the coffee side, or is there price investment on the other side of your beverage portfolio? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [18]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's really green pricing-driven. You know our philosophy, and there is a big competitor here. And obviously consumers are expecting some great coffee prices when the market goes the way it is. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jason English,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [19]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And you made reference -- sorry, last question and I'll pass it on. You made reference in the release to unfavorable pricing net of commodity costs for the overall business and for the segment. Are you -- are the competitive dynamics such that you actually need to price down ahead of getting cost relief? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [20]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, let me -- I want Tim to comment here on PNOC in general. But I want to talk about pricing power and the promotional environment. 
This is a strapped consumer. And it is not surprising to see retailers doing a lot of price matching. But we and the rest of this industry, I think we need to continue to provide value and accommodate consumer needs. For us, that includes our play book of good-better-best price pack architecture, offering value through quality, investing in innovation and marketing, small- and large-size packs that follow the consumer's budget. 
And when we get it right, even in a recession -- and I point to cheese especially, or Mac & Cheese and Velveeta. And even with a strapped consumer, we see growth in our brands and our categories. But I will turn it over to Tim for more specifics on PNOC. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [21]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, in general, I want to make sure that everybody understands PNOC is pricing net of commodities. And it primarily pertains to those business where a high portion of the raw material component parts is from a one single commodity. We endeavor to pass through price, consistent with those major underlying shifts in commodities. 
It's an imperfect science. There's market dynamics out there. We try to fill in the timing gap to the best of our ability with hedging. And our philosophy there is, hedge until we can price. 
But again, it's an imperfect -- and I would say, we look at that over time. If you went back to 2012, you would see that we were materially favorable on a PNOC basis. And you would see that on a year-to-date basis, were some unfavorable. The balance of the two years, over which really is a reasonable period to be thinking about averaging it down, we are in pretty good shape. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jason English,  Goldman Sachs - Analyst    [22]

Thanks a lot, guys.

Chris Growe, Stifel. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [24]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just had a question for you here regarding SG&A, which in the quarter was down. And I was just curious. Is the shift in advertising at all -- or maybe you can talk about the underlying overheads or things that may be benefit ting SG&A in the quarter? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [25]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, it is overwhelmingly positive from a cost-reduction, from an SG overhead reduction standpoint. The 2012 is a little bit unreliable, because it was carve-out financials for the third quarter within Mondelez. 
But nonetheless, our restructuring and our cost reduction, overhead reduction programs are really kicking in, and contributing nicely. In fact, the advertising investment actually was up in the quarter, we will say, strong double-digits. So it wasn't a reduction of advertising that's caused the reduction in SG&A. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [26]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, and then -- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [27]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our goal is to be as lean as the St. Louis Cardinals. (laughter) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [28]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And hopefully, you have more than just 22 year-old pitchers to rely on. (laughter) And we are hoping for a win tonight. 
So one other question I had for you was -- and Tony, you gave some of the businesses, the brands in the portfolio that need to still be fixed. And I want to be clear. Are you at a stage now, given the launch of new JELL-O products and the marketing that -- is that a brand that you expect or you hope that maybe next quarter or soon you could take off that list of ones that still needs some work? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [29]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. You know, we are in this for the long term. That is a key brand at Kraft. You're not going to read results of rebuilding and reinvesting in a brand that has been under invested in for a long time. Quickly. I think in six months, I will have a good story to tell you on JELL-O. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Growe,  Stifel Nicolaus - Analyst    [30]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, great. Well, thanks for much.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [32]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just a follow-up on Jason's questions on coffee. If you step back now, Tony, we are almost two years past the point where the Starbucks business went away. So you have had an opportunity to see how Gevalia fits in a premium strategy, how your portfolio performs now, or how it stacks up relative to some of your competitors. 
And I know that we are hearing that -- there is some talk, at least in the industry, that you might be considering partnering or doing something more substantial in the premium end of the coffee category. So if you could just talk about how you feel about your premium strategy today, your product line-up today, and whether or not there's anything to those talks. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [33]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, thanks, Bryan. I would rather talk facts than rumors. And given the question, I want to give you facts. 
Kraft and McDonald's are out selling a test market as part of a comprehensive coffee collaboration in the US. We want to work with McDonald's to help consumers enjoy McCafe Premium Coffee in the comfort and convenience of their own homes. 
This test will deliver McCafe in new formats. It will be a multiple test-market test, including roasted and ground bag coffees, and single cup offerings, in the coffee aisles of retail stores. 
You know, McDonald's is a global icon, with proven success, branding innovation. They are a great partner to complement what is our vast coffee expertise. Products, process and people, to take the great McCafe brand to consumers and retail stores. And we look forward, and we are excited about this upcoming test market. 
And we think it complements our offerings. You know we have Maxwell House. You know we have a strong Gevalia. We are in month 18, and we have exceeded our expectations. And you know about our cake-cup approach through Tassimo- and Keurig-compatible cups. 
We believe in coffee, and we have been telling you how much we believe in it. And I hope that this action proves our commitment to this great category. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [34]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It sounds like a really good positioning, in between Maxwell House and Gevalia. With McCafe, do you see it -- in terms of the way you have studied it and thought about a rollout -- do you see it competing against, I would assume, Dunkin and Starbucks, in that end of the market? Is that where you see the positioning? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [35]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, that's what our test market is for, right? And for competitive reasons, I don't want to go any further. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bryan Spillane,  BofA Merrill Lynch - Analyst    [36]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thank you.

David Driscoll,  Citigroup - Analyst    [38]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Apologies for the voice, I'm sick, so I sound horrible. But I'm doing fine. 
First question for you is, what is the impact to the food stamp program change? Tony, in the past, I know you've talked that this is important to Kraft consumers. Can you share with us your thoughts about the impact? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [39]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, we share with the industry, the GMA, the belief that SNAP is an important tool in the fight against hunger. And that it provides deeply needed assistance to American families who are struggling. It is very difficult to figure out what gets cut from SNAP and how it affects a family budget in our forecast. 
We do believe people have to eat. It remains critical for us in this environment to provide our good-better-best price value offerings in as many categories as possible. And to make sure that we are serving the needs of all American households, big and small, rich and poor.

Okay. On beverage, you made those great comments about coffee.  But beverage profits were down quite substantially. Was coffee the reason why profits were down? Or was it powdered beverage or something else? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [41]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I would be careful of looking at a quarter-to-quarter. Because there's seasonality in this category, and it moves around quite a bit. And it was a fairly -- not a real big summer, and we have some great summer beverages. 
But we saw merchandising activity step up. We weren't able to supply last year -- if you remember, in terms of our Capri Sun and business, we weren't getting the forecast right in those offerings, Capri Sun versus Kool-Aid Jammers. So we saw a pretty high merchandising cost in the quarter that is more normalized, frankly, than what it was last year. And I think that affected it more than, say, green coffee costs. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Driscoll,  Citigroup - Analyst    [42]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And if I could just sneak one last point in, a clarification. When you talk about pricing, I know you are rational. But do you think that pricing in the grocery store is rational at this time? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [43]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wow. I think this is a very interesting, strapped consumer market, where people are trying to drive volume and traffic in stores. And you are seeing some irrationality. 
But it is not surprising, given the state of the American consumer. So, I think we are all trying to do our best in what is a difficult market for building volume in traffic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Moskow,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [48]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was just looking at your bridge, and I wanted to know. Aren't there still some dis-synergies in your numbers this quarter? I think it was related to pension expense that you are absorbing. And I thought that those dis-synergies might go away in fourth quarter, maybe through restructuring programs. 
Can you talk about how that is impacting your numbers right now? And maybe that's in that negative $0.02 change from operations? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [49]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, Rob, it is embedded in the numbers we have reflected in operations. It's a combination of things. It is costs associated with being a stand-alone Company. We have to have an independent treasury department, controllers department, tax department, et cetera. 
So there were probably somewhere in the $100 million-a-year worth of what we would call stand-alone dis-synergies. And while we will not make those go away, we said that we would lower our overall overhead and SG&A costs to more than offset that dis-synergy component. 
And first of all, fourth quarter, we will lap those costs. So they, for practical purposes, will go from away from a delta standpoint. But again, you see that overall SG&A and overhead cost has declined overall. And that is attributable to our cost savings initiatives more than offsetting the dis-synergy piece. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Moskow,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [50]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. But it bodes for a -- or it sets tougher comparison year-over-year. So how much do you think of those $0.02 was from the dis-synergies? Was it all of it? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [51]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, in the third quarter, we were not lapping. So there was a piece of it, I would say -- there is a piece of it. I'm not sure I'm going to quantify it as the full $0.02. But I would say there was a piece of it. There is also, quite frankly, embedded in there, some restructuring costs that you see remaining in the number. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - VP, IR    [52]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rob, what we did quantify -- what Tim was talking about in the opening comments was, although the $0.02 down in the quarter, we had a $0.04 headwind because of the additional volume that we shipped last year in the third quarter. So if you take that out, then you're actually up $0.02 year-on-year, from a change from operations. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Robert Moskow,  Credit Suisse - Analyst    [53]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And could I ask a marketing question about JELL-O? I noticed that it's being televised on the World Series, mostly viewed by men. The characters in the ad are men. I'm just wondering, are you changing the target of the brand, or is it the same target? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [54]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, same target.  And just a great media buy on the World Series, that is actually watched by a lot of families. And you're going to see a lot of pool partners in that advertising that are not just men.

Matthew Grainger,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [57]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony, thanks for your thoughts on what is driving the added value consciousness at the consumer level. But just to revisit some of the factors and the dynamics that you cited. Those all seem valid, but what I'm still wondering, why would the consumer environment have gotten immeasurably worse here during the third quarter? What changed on the margin, as far as you're seeing it, over the past few months? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [58]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I think you've got to talk about confidence, right -- consumer confidence, when it comes to this. You've got a government that closes. You've got gas prices that were quite high and spiked, luckily, they are coming down now. Payroll taxes of still a falling labor participation rate. 
And I think that there really is a lack of confidence in the consumer in this getting better. And I think a lot of people have been out of work a long time. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew Grainger,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [59]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [60]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is some momentum that builds, even though the employment rate looks like it is ticking to a better place. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew Grainger,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [61]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then just on a category-specific level, I wanted to come back -- Mac & Cheese has been a big contributor to your top line over the past year or two. You called out Velveeta growth here in the release. But in aggregate, it seems like we might be seeing the category lose a little bit of its momentum, relative to the really strong growth it was generating for most of the last year or two. 
Is that consistent with what you are seeing? And given your dominance in that category, do you think over the coming months that a bit more needs to be done to boost growth in that brand? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [62]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. I think we look at this as dinners, right? We have a big Velveeta dinners franchise. And obviously the Mac & Cheese franchise, which is critical to us. 
It has been a very competitive category that I honestly look at positively. Because we and our competitors need to grow categories, not just trade share. 
So you've had some new formidable entries that have been well-supported, and you see market share jump around a little bit. You know we went at it with Hamburger Helper, with Velveeta. Now we are going at it with some of the offerings from some other people. 
This is a category that is critical to us and to the retailer. And I think you will see it hang in there. I still think it is very well-positioned in this market for -- especially given a strapped consumer. Because it offers real value through product quality, our marketing and our innovation to compete. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew Grainger,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [63]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. But even -- and thanks Tony, but even absent the competition, it seems like the category as a whole may have lost a little bit of the volume momentum that it had. Is there something that needs to be done from an innovation standpoint? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [64]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I always would tell you there is something that needs to be done from an innovation standpoint. And I think you will see some great things coming from Kraft in the coming months. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew Grainger,  Morgan Stanley - Analyst    [65]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. Thanks again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You joined Kraft Foods? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thilo Wrede,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [68]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, I do appreciate the offer. So I guess we can talk about it offline. (laughter) 
First question I had -- I'm still learning my new business I guess. Planters -- I appreciate everything you have done around the brand. I'm wondering though, can you quantify how much the changes in the competitive environment in this segment space has helped the brand? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - VP, IR    [69]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, it's a fair question, given the upheaval you see from time to time in some of these companies. I do think what is most important is, this category is hot. Protein is hot. Whether it is peanuts, cashews, almonds or pistachios, this is a place that is drawing a lot of interest. 
For us, we have a branded equity, versus what is a lot of private label competition. And our point is to build differentiation and execute our play book across the total brand. 
You know that we have -- we are in an interesting cost position. Because we started in a place where we had a lot of runway, in terms of our lean Six Sigma, our integrated business planning, and what we can do in our plans. And we are seeing that pay off. And it follows our critical principle of reinvesting $0.50 of those cost gains into our brands and our people. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thilo Wrede,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [70]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then the other question I had was a little bit broader. But we have seen as we consumer-forward three of fours years from now, and it doesn't seem to get better. I recall, Tony, you talked at Cagny this year about the trifurcated consumer, not just the bifurcated consumer. 
How much does that impact how you prioritize your R&D? Are you focusing more on the good part of the good-better-best portfolio? Are you focusing more on value categories, for lack of a better term? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [71]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, it is a great observation and insight. And, yes, if you look at us and some of the competitors I respect the most, figuring out innovation in the good, without sacrificing margins, is a huge challenge and opportunity. And it has a lot to do with what we call price pack architecture. 
Interestingly, it has a lot to do with the fact that club and dollar stores are the only channels that are growing. Think about that. Think of all the outlets in America, and traffic is only growing at club and dollar. And think about why. It's price pack architecture and value that those two places own uniquely. 
And so, yes, you are right. Your insight is correct. And I think it's not just Kraft that has to figure this out and do a better job of it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thilo Wrede,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [72]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And I apologize for the follow-up, but club and dollar are different consumer segments, right? Does that make the R&D challenge for you bigger because you have to go after two different segments? Or do you focus on one of the two of them? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [73]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, I turn it to the glass half full. I think great brands can straddle the different consumers that exist in these different outlets. 
And I would debate you a little that club is a different consumer then dollar. There is a lot of value in both of those consumer sets. But we've got to be able to get both ends pleased. 
And we think that when we do it right -- and you've seen the brands we do it in. Interestingly, a Mac & Cheese or a Velveeta does very well on both ends of that spectrum, whether it is a $1 cup of Mac & Cheese or the large sizes that offer real family value. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [74]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That's the difference is, it is probably more of a packaging statement than it is a product statement. The difference between club and dollar probably is a different package size and configuration. And we are working on that. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thilo Wrede,  Jefferies & Co. - Analyst    [75]

Ken Goldman,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [78]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony, you cited the difficulty in getting a bang for your buck on promotions. And Nielsen data suggests this is true across the board in food. 
I guess I'm not quite sure I understand this phenomenon. My expectation would have been that a cash-strapped consumer would maybe respond better to deals than usual? So I'm just curious how to think about that. 
And then as a side question, how are you faring in terms of returns on advertising? Are you getting the sales lift from that expenditure you would normally expect there? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [79]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, great. Thanks, Ken. So the first answer I will give you -- imagine a food class of trade with traffic declining. And putting out the same promotions, and even more attractive promotions, with less people coming through their store. 
And then added to a consumer behavior that has really changed, we have described this as consumers using stores as their pantry. When you and I grew up in Philadelphia, our moms had a pantry full of product. Today, moms have maybe a day or two. And in some cases, nothing in the pantry, they are buying day to day. 
So what you have is, traditional promotion behavior on the part of the customer and us, and less people to walk into that store and buy it. And less commitment to fill their pantries with product. So the typical pantry load promotion doesn't seem to work as well. So that's my -- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Goldman,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [80]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, that is helpful. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [81]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- behavioral. Advertising is a key question. And I'm a big believer in equity advertising. I think it continues to work in this environment. I hate to think what would happen if we stopped advertising. 
We have obviously got to be better at the effectiveness of those ads. Because it's a totally different consumer and a totally different media. I mean, it is online. The millennial doesn't really watch TV, but they still want brands, and they still want good value for the money. And they still believe in brands that have critical advantages. 
So when we get it right -- Philadelphia Cream Cheese or Velveeta advertising -- we are still getting the great paybacks on advertising. It is making sure that we really do this with a discipline. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ken Goldman,  JPMorgan - Analyst    [82]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And then one more, if I can. I realize you're not going to provide specific guidance for 2014, but a couple quick questions. First, are you still expecting the same benefit or change in restructuring charges versus 2013 that you previously guided to? 
And second, are there any other headwinds and tailwinds, just qualitatively, we should be thinking about as we look forward to next year? Maybe items we are not necessarily thinking about. Non recurring items, for example. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [83]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No, Ken, I don't anticipate any material other items impacting the year at this juncture. And yes, the step down from restructuring -- we will probably go out of this year with some $300 million. And as we've communicated in the past, on an ongoing basis, we are closer to $125 million. So you should expect to see the benefits of that step-down. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [87]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just two questions from me. First, just thinking about fourth quarter for a minute. You expect organic growth to well-outpace the rate of market growth. 
Last year, organic growth, I think, was down some 7% or so. And I think half of it was due to the pull-forward of inventory into the third quarter, and half of it was just additional inventory draw down at retail, if I recall right. 
So do you get all of that back in the fourth quarter? Such that inorganic growth is up high single-digit? Or is there some other things in there that impacted that I am not aware of? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [88]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I will start out by saying it is not our practice to provide point estimates on quarterly numbers. Last year, as you point out, was a particularly unusual quarter, with significant draw downs on retail inventories, in addition to the impact from our separation-related third-quarter build. 
The best I can say is that certainly we would expect that what we call Project Gemini, the separation-related, should come back to us. The inventory draw down, we think we went out of the fourth quarter last year, and we think we went into the fourth quarter this year with pretty normalized levels. 
So I would think of low single-digit as the level. Although Chris Jakubik is kicking me for giving any numbers here. But low single-digits is probably where we would expect to be. Kind of makes up for the Gemini-related and some normal growth. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Andrew Lazar,  Barclays Capital - Analyst    [89]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thanks for that. And then Tony, maybe I could just push back a little bit on some of the PNOC commentary from earlier in the call. Only because you push back quite hard on us, or at least me sometimes, for ever suggesting Kraft is more of a pass-through business. 
And I know that you're trying to get it so that less and less of it is, over time. But certainly of late, and let's say, you call it this year -- it seems to be behaving more like a pass-through business, right? Given that pricing is coming down ahead of where lower commodity costs may be flowing through the P&L, and things of that nature. 
Are we talking about just, we are in an extraordinary environment here that is putting that level of pressure on things? And that underlying things really have changed for the better, from a pass-through perspective? 
Or -- I'm trying to come to terms with that. Because that is one of the big things that, even during the separation, I think, folks were trying to get a better handle on, in terms of the portfolio and what it was really ultimately capable of. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [90]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, it is fair. I twitch every time you say that pass-through word. So here's my answer. 
Obviously, we are in categories that some might call pass-through by virtue of commodity kind of behavior. And its meat, and it's cheese and dairy, and it's coffee, and it's nuts, right? 
If you look at, even before the spin, the last two years, cheese and dairy, across all those categories, margins are up, volume is up, share is up, dollars are up. We are working on dollars, not margin percent, right? If you look at Planters of late -- and I think it is the start of a bend-the-trend -- same story. If you look at coffee, same story. Right? 
Now, there are a lot of factors here, Andrew. And we do have this wind at our back called productivity that we were in the right place at the right time. And I think, did the right kind of be-your-own-activist things. But I -- the last thing I want is to believe that I don't have the same opportunity to grow great brands that you might call pass-through, and I would just call great brands. 
Is Philly a commodity? I don't think so. Is Planters? I don't think so. I mean, we won with the Mr. Peanut heritage, and it seems to still have value. 
So we are always going to have this debate. But I think it is important never to look at PNOC in a quarter and/or year. It is important to look at it in a stacked two-year way. And on that analysis, I think the PNOC discipline is working in what you would call our faster categories. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [91]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I would agree with what Tony said. And while I can't give you all of the specifics, but if you really looked at a two-year look in 2012 and 2013, you would see a very different picture from what you looked just this quarter. You would see actually that we are favorable on a two-year basis, overall.

Tony, coming back to Oscar Mayer, lunch meat remains weak, as you pointed out in your comments. But now you have some new leadership, and Stoll and Sam are coming on board. So if you could, is there anything in particular that you can maybe point to in terms of where you think execution could maybe be different or better? And maybe what changes investors are likely to see with the new leadership coming on board? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [95]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. First, let me say something about leadership changes. 
Oscar, by the way -- this is the tyranny of when you look at quarters or one year. If you look at the last seven years of Oscar, Nick Merrigioli you would say is a Hall of Famer in the world of marketing. Oscar outgrew almost every -- well, it outgrew all the competitors in its business, and most food and beverage. 
It's been a tough cold cuts year. But I don't want to miss the fact that it's been a great bacon year. It's been a solid hotdog year. It's been an incredible Lunchable year, right? All of those basically lunch meat kind of franchises. 
What is going on in cold cuts is a very interesting phenomenon. And that is, a big competitor comes in -- and I would name them Tyson, right? Who grabs the low-end of the price point, a formidable one. We probably should have acted sooner, I said that. 
And importantly, great marketing by the deli competitors. And you know their names.  I don't want to give them too much credit. 
But we have seen 4 share points move from a processed lunch meat to the deli counter. We actually experienced this 10 years ago, long before me and Nick Merrigioli at the time bought them off and grabbed those 4 share points back. But now that Nick is -- he's got 10 years on the business. We have a chance with Sam to have a meat guy, to bring some fresh eyes, a different way of looking at it, after a great run by the current team. 
And I think you're going to see us doing some of the things out of the old play book, and some of the things to grab back that cold cuts share. It is a critically important business to us and to the retailer. It is a big part of Kraft, and it is something we have built a lot of growth on over the years, and are looking at a tough 15 months or so. But I do believe sequentially you are seeing improvement, and you're going to see innovation and strategic pricing moves to improve it even more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [102]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just two questions. One, it seemed like gross margins moved down quite a bit in the quarter, both year-over-year and sequentially. Is that just a function of the fixed cost absorption? And why wouldn't all the cost savings offset that? 
Or is there some kind of negative mix? Maybe you can help with that one. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [103]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, the large piece of it -- we saw a relatively modest decline, but a decline nonetheless. First, I want to point out that you do have a movement that we have said before -- we are very focused on margin dollars. And that would pertain to the gross margin level as well. 
So to the extent you have movement in underlying commodities, and therefore pricing, it will impact that. And also, we are focused on a much longer period than just a quarter. 
But having said that, yes, the additional absorption of a whole array of different things -- manufacturing costs and actually down into some of the trade -- would have had an impact when we pick up all that additional volume from what we did at the end of the second quarter for that inventory build in the trade. That was the biggest piece of it, I would say. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [104]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And that's -- is that -- was the quarter -- did you have lower input costs in the quarter? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [105]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are focused on a PNOC basis. And on balance, our PNOC was some unfavorable in the quarter. So that's the bet -- how we think about it. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chris Jakubik,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - VP, IR    [106]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Input costs were actually higher year on year, Eric. What you saw coming through was just, as Tim said -- all the ship-ahead in the third quarter of last year provided quite a bit of favorability. And if you look at -- if you are really focused on the margins, you would notice that the Q3 gross margin last year was the highest that it's been in recent history. And that was really the extra volume coming through. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [107]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you think about this year, there's probably a bit more normalized. Obviously we will continue to endeavor to improve it as we drive cost and productivity. But this is probably a bit more normalized than thinking about last year as normal. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [108]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay. And then to Tony with regard to next year. I know that you got this windfall of less restructuring savings, to the extent that you are focused on GAAP. And that is going to make your EBIT growth, the way some people model it and the way you have suggested, to be much stronger than your long-term target. 
But given the state of the consumer, and what sounded like a lot of price competition in some key categories like salad dressings and others. Why wouldn't you spend some of that back into the market more aggressively, if, again, your long-term target is mid single-digit EBIT growth?

Well, you're talking to a marketer about spending more aggressively. And I -- by the way, I am always careful, Eric, to talk about equity spending. Because of the time that I slipped and you told me that I was going to increase the spending in promotion. Which I will do, but I -- you know what, with --?

Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [110]

I'm going to blame Lazard. It was Lazard. (laughter) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [111]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But Tim and Terry, I'm going to be fighting the battle you just described. When I've got margin, materiality, momentum and message -- and the last one is the hardest -- on my side, I want to re-establish spending in my great brand portfolio. 
I don't have Maxwell House back on the air to any great degree. And imagine, it's the $1 billion brand, or an $800 million-some brand. And I've got lots on my hit list.  Or as we create the virtuous cycle, let's spend. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [112]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I agree with that, Tony. I would point out, though, that we need to make sure that we have all of the M's lined up, and that we are going to generate a good return on those investments. So that I would say, generally, that's been our constraining factor, more so than the dollar availability. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eric Katzman,  Deutsche Bank - Analyst    [113]

Okay, I will pass it off. Thanks.

We've heard from a few companies this quarterly reporting period that the North American consumer market is changing faster than companies have expected. And it seems like you are echoing that a little today. 
Do you think that you have not only the innovative ideas around packaging and pricing and so on, that you mentioned, but also the internal systems in place to allow you to react to the challenging market dynamics? And if not, what can you realistically do to improve and shorten your reaction time to unexpected consumer behavior movements? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [116]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the headline is -- yes, we think we have the people, the processes, the products in place to compete, even in this tough environment. Just to echo some of your assumptions, I do believe that those people that are talking to you are right. I do believe it is a tough environment. 
I do believe the momentum is building, especially in fourth quarter, because of this reduction in SNAP that has been talked about and is real, that starts basically right now. And some have talked about this, and I think it is a factor that you can study, that the holidays are tighter, late Thanksgiving to Christmas, than they are six out of seven years, right? And that means one less paycheck for a lot of people. And one less paycheck in this environment is a big deal. 
So short-term, wind is in our face. Nobody loves it, but we operate in it. And we believe our play book -- price pack architecture, good-better-best offerings to offer value, and investing for the long term in innovation and marketing and advertising -- are the right way to compete. 
We also believe we have some very important family food products that they can't live without. So we've got to make them affordable and make sure we have the offerings they need. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alicia Forry,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [117]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thanks. And then if I could just have one quick follow-on. Promotion levels, year-on-year. 
I think you mentioned in the last quarter that, for you, they were down 8% compared to an industry that had promotional levels down a little over 1%, I believe. I was just wondering how that developed during Q3, if you could give us any numbers around that? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [118]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, it's more normalized. And I think I mentioned, one of our big brands was out of stock last third quarter. It was back in stock, Capri Sun, this quarter. And so we merchandised it, because it is in season. 
So you saw more normalization for us, but we still remain committed to being rational. We remain -- to keep our focus on profitable sustainable growth. And to make sure that we use promotion as only one lever to adjust the price points that are appropriate for some of our brands. But more importantly, that we spend the bulk of our money against long-term equity building in our brands. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alicia Forry,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [119]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So the industry wasn't more promotional necessarily, or at least significantly -- not significantly more promotional in Q3 versus -- 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tim McLevish,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CFO    [120]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There was quite a bit of price matching going on in our retailers. And that is a reaction to a strapped consumer. And in the end, we all pay for that. So I don't have the exact promotional spend quarter to quarter, but we could follow up with you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alicia Forry,  Canaccord Genuity - Analyst    [121]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Okay, thanks.

Sorry about the technical glitch earlier. I am in a hotel room in Alaska, where the lights went out and the phone went dead. I'm still here the dark. 
I wanted to ask about new products as a percent of sales. Cagny earlier this year -- you obviously had a fantastic ramp-up on new products as a percent of sales between 2009 and 2012. But it seems as though cannibalization, slowdowns in certain categories, and some of your really good new platforms have begun to kick in. 
Do you think that surge is effecting sales as a proportion of new products? Is it a sustainable number? Is that -- when we get into 2014, 2015 and taking that level or even higher. And do you feel that you've got the product innovation pipeline that will allow that to continue? Thank you. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony Vernon,  Kraft Foods Group Inc - CEO    [125]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, thanks, Alexia. It is a critical part of our strategy to double that innovation percent and be consistent about it from mid single-digits to low double digits. And you have seen -- I've talked about the impact our K-Cups this year and of creating $100 million franchise in a year on K-Cups from scratch. 
We are committed to making sure the power of Krafts are indeed marketing and sales. It's those numbers we talked about at Cagny.

Great, thanks everyone. For any follow-up questions, Tony Vernon and I will be around to take your questions and then for anybody from the media, Basil Maglaris and Jean Hemme will be around to receive your questions as well. Thanks very much, and Happy Halloween.
