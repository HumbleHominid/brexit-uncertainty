Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Deutsche Post DHL conference call regarding the first-quarter results 2016.
At this time all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode.
The floor will be open for questions following the presentation.
Let me now turn the floor over to your host, Mr.
Martin Ziegenbalg.
Thank you and hello and good afternoon or good morning to everyone out there to our Q1 2016 results call.
I take it you have the material in front of you.
You may have found that we are striving to be even more compact and concise in our messaging, so the interim report has been melting down from 48 pages to 28 pages without slipping any material information we think.
And in the same spirit we want to be as crisp as possible on the Q1 presentations.
As you know, we have our Group CEO, Frank Appel and our Group CFO, Larry Rosen, with us who are going to take you through the main highlights of the presentation that we sent out this morning.
After that we've got time for Q&A.
We hope to be done in about an hour's time.
And without further ado over to you Frank.
Thank you Martin.
Good afternoon, good morning to everybody.
Thank you for joining us today.
So let me just start on Page 2 by saying that without a doubt we have had a good start into the year with the double-digit increase in Group EBIT supported by all our divisions.
Our PeP division has seen good growth thanks to continued rise in parcel volumes and increased pricing for mail products.
express continued to grow strongly with the disciplined yield management contributing to earnings growth.
The turnaround in DGF is working as the division further improved its operating performance despite a challenging market environment.
And finally supply chain has taken the chance to use additional proceeds from the sale of King's Cross for further restructuring efforts, but the business has continued to show solid improvement year over year.
I therefore can confirm our 2016 and 2020 EBIT targets.
And before I talk a little bit more about the PeP and the DGF division I hand over to Larry for some more numbers.
Yes, thank you and welcome also from my side.
So as Frank just explained the broad picture and will also review performance in detail for each division, let me point out a few notable items on the P&L that we see here on Page 3.
So again there were a series of exogenous factors that have driven reported revenue growth down year over year.
So in addition to FX or foreign currency changes the changed revenue recognition on the NHS contract, and also lower fuel surcharges, we had organic revenue growth of 1.4% plus, reflecting only moderate GDP tailwind and continued negative growth in forwarding.
The financial result reflects currency exchange rate losses which we've incurred for some currencies in countries with very high inflation, such as Egypt, Argentina and Venezuela.
And, as you will have noted, our tax rate stands now at 14%, which is our current full-year expectation versus our initial guidance at 18%.
And this reduction primarily relates to the positive impact of a project in Germany during Q1.
So our bottom line shows a 29% increase, broadly reflecting and driven by the 21% increase in operating income.
Now over to Page 4 where we look at our cash flow summary.
We've seen a lot of the usual seasonal pattern in Q1 with cash outflow driven by the full-year contribution for civil servant pensions, or the once-a-year contribution for civil servant pensions, and also some anticipated phasing effect after the very strong year-end working capital performance.
Net CapEx spending was about flat year over year and also in line with our full year plan.
On Page 5 you see the net debt development where we went up almost EUR900m in net debt during the quarter.
As in previous years, you can expect that net debt will increase further in Q2 due to the dividend payment before we see the usual strong deleveraging again in the second half.
Note that starting in Q2 we have begun executing on our share buyback where we've so far completed EUR100m out of the possible EUR1b program.
So a word about a key balance sheet topic on Page 6, our pension liability.
We've issued some bonds right at the beginning of Q2 and we achieved a very attractive average coupon rate of 72.5 basis points and it included a record-low coupon of 37.5 basis points for the five-year tranche for any corporate.
The higher expected return that we believe we can achieve on plan asset investments should lead to a small accretive effect both on operating cash flow and net income, while a EUR1b additional funding of our pension liabilities will, of course, reduce the pension provision, as shown in the April 1 pro-forma calculation on the top right of this page.
Note that over the quarter the provision actually increased by around EUR570m, mainly reflecting the typical volatility driven by the decrease in discount rates which reflected the lower interest rate environment during the quarter.
So let me come now to begin our division highlights and cover express first and then supply chain.
And then I'll hand back to Frank for the other two divisions.
So express has seen continued strong volume performance in the core TDI segment with growth of 7.9%, supported by growth in all regions, including 7% growth in Asia.
Revenue per day growth is lower at 4.9% due to the impact of lower fuel surcharges, which is also somewhat covering up or masking our underlying good and disciplined yield management.
Onto Page 8 for the summary financials for express.
Again revenue growth was 6.1% organic excluding FX effects and also the fuel surcharge impact.
With FX headwinds partly mitigated by pricing, or yield and other measures EBIT growth in express was again a very solid 7.5%.
We also had in the quarter for the first time an 11% EBIT margin for the division.
express operating cash flow is showing the year-end phasing effects we've seen throughout the Group, while the steep CapEx increase reflects more just timing effects on the already-planned network investment.
Now onto supply chain on Page 9.
We've seen here sound new order intake of EUR276m for the quarter.
Please be aware that, as already in Q4, the sales contribution for life science and healthcare sector is held back by the changed revenue recognition related to procurement management for our NHS contract.
And again we started to see the effect of that contract change in Q4.
Now we have it in Q1 and will continue to see the effect in Q2 and Q3 before we normalize again in Q4 of this year.
So now on Page 10 we see that the NHS contract change is also the main reason for the 14% revenue decline for the division.
In addition we had adverse foreign exchange and also effects from the lower fuel prices so that organic revenue growth, correcting for all three items, would have been plus 2.4% for the division.
The first-quarter EBIT includes EUR62m (sic - see Page 10 "EUR63m") of net gains from the stake of our -- from the sale of our final stake in King's Cross.
We expect this amount to be roughly neutralized over the year as we'll implement additional restructuring measures.
These additional restructuring measures are a follow-up to the successful 2015 measures and will support supply chain in its target to reach an EBIT margin of 4% to 5% by 2020.
In this Q1 restructuring costs were about EUR25m.
Hence, excluding King's Cross and the restructuring investment, the division showed a solid operating performance supported by restructuring benefits from investments that we made last year and also good new business start-ups.
At this point let me hand back over to Frank to continue the presentation.
Thank you Larry.
Let me come on Page 11 to PeP.
So the mail communication figures clearly show the benefit of the stamp price increase, where revenues were flat despite the volume decline we have seen of 5.8%.
Given one more working day and the expected impact from the price increase the volume decline was more or less in line with our long-term expectations, reflecting only a minor elasticity impact from the price increase.
We've seen sustained growth in parcel Germany, with volumes up by 5.5% and revenue increasing by 6.9%, so showing a positive price mix effect, which is very good.
Again, keep in mind we had one day less -- one less working day, so the adjusted volume increase was rather 7.2%, which is on our -- on the upper end of our long-term guidance of 5% to 7%.
We also see that our investments into international parcel operations generate the expected growth traction, with double-digit revenue growth in parcel Europe [as well as] DHL e-commerce.
So on Page 12, looking at the PeP P&L, I've touched on the most important revenue and EBIT drivers already.
Note that due to the price increase at the beginning of the year we have seen more customers buy and stock up on new stamps so that we had an addition of a stamp provision of EUR34m in the quarter.
While growth in German parcels and the stamp price increase drive overall EBIT growth, the investments in our parcel e-commerce activities outside Germany are currently offsetting the underlying strong top- and bottom-line performance of that very important strategic initiative.
Let me therefore give you a quick status update on where we are standing with our international parcels set-up.
So in Europe, on Page 13, we are tackling a flexible and tailored approach to address the very attractive international e-commerce opportunities.
Our presence in Benelux, Poland, the Czech Republic and Sweden is based on domestic legacy assets transferred internally from DHL and now reoriented from most B2B to -- to both B2B and, increasingly, B2C.
This year, as you might know, we have bought a stake in Relais Colis in France and launched our PAN-Nordics and Baltic partnership.
So in these countries we have partnered with well-established local players.
And finally in Australia and Czech Republic we have for specific local reasons taken a green-sheet approach and are rolling out our own new last-mile capabilities.
Our DHL parcel connect product therefore now harmonizes B2C parcels delivery across 15 European destinations and we'll keep a flexible approach in how we will further extend the reach of this network.
Our DHL e-commerce, on Page 14, operations tackle B2C opportunities outside of Europe with our main parcel activities as of today being in the US and India.
In the US we operate fulfillment centers for e-commerce and omni-channel customers and are the fourth-biggest market player with last-mile delivery done through US Postal Service.
In India we run the largest and most successful domestic B2B and B2C network, as you know, with Blue Dart and are actively extending our e-commerce capabilities both on the last mile and in e-fulfillment.
Earlier this year we also added capabilities in Thailand to our portfolio and now are really doing last-mile delivery as well in Thailand.
And DHL e-commerce is, of course, also offering bespoke solutions for cross-border e-commerce notable on the Asia inbound and Asia inbound trade lanes, as you can see from the figures for China here on the slide.
So let me now turn to global forwarding freight.
As you know, I'm still running that as the leader and responsible person.
We have seen unchanged, rather difficult market conditions especially with regards to air freight volumes and I assume you have seen that from our competitors as well.
However, I'm very pleased to see that our efforts to turn around our operating performance are starting to pay off.
Coupled with our selective commercial approach these measures have helped us to a significant increase in GP per unit in both air and ocean freight.
And you see even an absolute growth particularly at ocean freight.
But if you deduct the volume decline we have seen in air freight we have also a very nice development on the gross profit in air freight.
So on Page 16 you see the impact of the P&L.
Their revenue is strongly down from the combination of market weakness, lower freight rates, currency and fuel cost pressures.
Nevertheless, our divisional GP is nearly flat.
So our effort of refocusing on the operating business continues to pay off and resulted in an EBIT increase of -- to EUR51m.
This gives me very clear confidence that we are on the right track in this division even if we are, of course, still far away from the profitability level that we have had before in that business.
So therefore let me talk about our IT renewal roadmap on Page 17.
It of course remains one of the key enablers to bring profitability to a sustainable higher level.
We have made first steps in our IT renewal by identifying and launching the global rollout of selected systems we had already operational in some countries.
Additionally, we are examining and validating a software solution for the renewal of a core transportation management system.
This will all be a step-by-step approach, but I'm very confident that with the execution of our IT renewal we can progressively reduce and eventually close the GP-to-EBIT conversion gap towards our best-in-class peers in the global industry.
Just to conclude we have Page 18 and Page 19 regarding the guidance.
We today confirm our EBIT expectations for 2016 and 2020 as well as our cash flow and CapEx guidance for 2016.
Please note that the cash flow guidance remains unchanged, but is adjusted technically for the accounting treatment of the announced pension funding, as the funding itself is booked in operating cash flow by the bond financing as recognized through the financing cash flow and, hence, not part of the free cash flow calculation.
And as discussed the rate guidance has come down to 14% from 18%.
So to wrap up the quarter, we definitely had a good start into the year with the expected earnings momentum as we leave behind the 2015 transition year.
Our main growth drivers are intact, with parcel and TDI volumes continuing to grow with positive yields and the turnaround in DGF is showing further encouraging results.
And this all, of course, sees us progressing in line with our long-term ambitions laid down in our strategy 2020.
So, in summary, we really can say that what we have told you last year that this is a year of transition.
And of course we had some not so nice news.
We always were very confident that we can deliver on the restructuring we have done.
And I think you see in the first quarter the signs of what we have told you before.
And that's the reason why we are very pleased with the strong performance we have seen in Q1.
So thank you very much for listening and now I think the floor is yours.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Operator, initiate the Q&A please.
(Operator Instructions).
Stephen Furlong, Davy.
Good afternoon, two quick questions, Frank.
I was just wondering in terms of the price elasticity of mail communications do you think that there's still some strike effects coming through that you won't get back again post that in terms of the volumes?
You just might talk about -- I think you're quite happy with how the volume decline has been, given there was one less working day, as you said.
Just secondly I just wanted you maybe to comment.
An important supplier you have in the express, Atlas, had a big deal there with Amazon, and I just wondered if you'd generally just talk about your good relationship I think you have with Atlas.
Thank you.
Yes, so on the elasticity, so we have seen what we expected, that the first quarter will be slightly below the long-term guidance of 2% to 3%.
It's very difficult to judge how much is coming from price increase or a spillover from strike.
What we can say is that we have not lost many customers in the last months and, therefore, we think it comes more from price elasticity than the strike effect.
But it's too early to finally say that and we have to see longer in the year.
But as I said so far it is in line with what we expected for the first quarter.
Second, the Amazon Atlas, Atlas of course can work with other customers as we are working as a customer [of] them, and it has to our knowledge no impact on our operation.
So that's normal that airlines are working with several customers, they have done that already before and they continue to do so, so we don't expect any impact on our operations.
Okay, thank you.
You're welcome.
David Ross, Stifel.
Hi there.
Yes, good afternoon gentlemen.
Can you talk a little bit about how business has trended here in the second quarter to date?
Guidance is just confirmed and not taken up, so it sounded like some of the positive developments may not have gotten any better.
But I guess specifically as it relates to express and forwarding, about half way through the second quarter are you seeing trends improve, deteriorate, or stay about the same from first-quarter levels?
Yes, I think it's pretty much in line with our expectation.
It's factored into the confirmation of the full-year target and we really can't say much more than that at this point, so nothing really surprising so far in Q2.
David, any further questions?
(Multiple speakers).
Yes.
Frank, you're still running the global forwarding division as it turns around and makes improvement.
Where do you stand on the search for a new head of that division?
Yes, David, as usually we are not commenting on these kind of things anyway.
I can only tell you that I'm enjoying very much what I'm doing and, of course, I'm happy that we see the progress.
It helped me a lot to get a deeper understanding what went wrong in the first place and what we have to do now and I think anything else we will comment on when we have a decision on that.
And since that has not taken yet we can't comment on that.
Okay.
And then last question is just on the supply chain side.
The business that you're winning, do you consider that to be mainly new business to outsourcing in terms of something a company was doing themselves that they've now decided to outsource and DHL's that provider?
Or is it more market share driven, where they had been getting that service provided by another 3PL and now they're choosing DHL?
I think the majority is new outsourcing.
So it may not be a customer who's new to outsourcing, it might be a multi-national customer who's already been doing outsourcing for decades.
But maybe they have a new business that they're starting up, or they're expanding geographically and then they want to outsource their supply chain needs in that new region or country and then they work with us to do that.
So probably the majority of the new business wins fits into that category.
Excellent, thank you.
Johannes Braun, Commerzbank.
Yes, good afternoon.
Thanks for taking my questions.
I have two.
Firstly, on the free cash flow it seems that over the last couple of years this volatility between Q4 and Q1 in the working capital has become bigger and bigger.
I'm totally aware of the underlying drivers there with the pension payments and the working capital saving, but why is it becoming bigger and bigger that effect and how do we have to think about it going forward?
And then secondly, on supply chain, I'm not sure if I understood why you have further restructuring spend there, given that last year obviously you already spent EUR150m, which was more than initially planned, and now, if I understood correctly, another EUR60m.
So what's the background there please?
Yes, let me try to tackle both of those.
So one factor in the seasonality and the bigger and bigger phasing between Q4 and Q1 is that our business portfolio is increasingly seasonal, with the strong growth in parcel and e-commerce mostly in the PeP division, but also to a certain extent in the other divisions, in particular, express, and also a little bit in supply chain and forwarding.
There is more seasonality overall in our business than there was before and so this is what -- one of the factors that's driving this big effect.
So I just think it's something that we have to live with.
We would love if the cash flow was exactly smooth over the four quarters, but it's not, and I think we'll see this kind of significant seasonal trend pretty much going forward.
So for the supply chain restructuring I think it's worth noting that supply chain is a business that's always going to have some low level of restructuring.
It's a collection of almost 3,000 contractual relationships with customers.
And there's always going to be one or the other of those relationships that's ending, potentially a customer that's gone bankrupt, potentially a contract that just reaches its natural end and now we have to exit from a site.
So there's -- you can't even really talk about that low level of restructuring as a one-time event.
The EUR60m that we're going to invest this year certainly includes that, but goes beyond it, and really is a continuation of the successful program that we've already started and significantly completed in 2015.
But there's just more to do.
And we're fortunate that the gain from King's Cross is able to offset those expenditures this year, but we think the about EUR60m that we want to invest this year is very well invested.
And again it's going to help us even toward the end of this year, but certainly in future years, at continually improving profitability for that business.
Can you give some color what you --what exactly you are doing?
Yes, I think again it's closing or modifying unprofitable sites and taking care of the obligations, whether it's remaining lease obligations or employee separations that we have at some individual sites.
Perfect.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, thanks, Johannes.
And the next caller please?
Damian Brewer, Royal Bank of Canada.
Hi, Damian.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon everybody.
Hi, Damian.
I've got a couple of questions, if I can.
First off, can I just turn attention to PeP and mail ?
And just particularly when one looks at the Dialog marketing volumes as well within the letter mail business as a whole volumes looked like they were down very modestly, one working day adjusted.
Could you elaborate a little bit more on the impact of the price rises on January 1 how much of them have filtered through bulk mail contracts at the moment?
How much is to come and, therefore, where we stand on the potential demand burn off versus price rise in the business?
And was that in line with expected trajectory, or doing better or worse than that?
And then the second question really on the express business.
I'm just wondering, I think you closed out last year with something in the low to mid 90s in terms of on-time delivery quality.
How much further can that go?
Or is there a point where you stop putting in incremental cost to do that?
And is there any impact of that in the Q1 numbers for express?
Thank you.
Damian, maybe on the first one, so, of course, the pricing is only for the regular mail communication.
So on the Dialog marketing that's a different game anyway and we have not applied the stamp price increase there.
So the volume development is probably because we have a stabilization on the usage of direct mailings.
On-time delivery I think there's always a question.
I think what Ken and his team are always doing is they are balancing service quality, which we see as a competitive advantage with the cost which comes with it, and so far they have done pretty well.
A lot of improvement actually comes also from the day-to-day operations.
So I think we see also a continuation of the impact of our certified training program [so people] very well understand what it means to deliver on time.
And that's the reason why we have seen a continuation of service quality.
So we believe service quality makes a significant difference.
The out-performance of market growth for, now, I would say four years probably, confirms that.
Therefore, we will continue, but we always will keep a cost in focus that we are not buying service quality by investing a lot of money.
We are getting better service quality by improving the day-to-day operations.
Okay, thank you.
Can I just follow-up on the mail one, though?
In terms of your large mail contracts how much of that has been affected by price in Q1?
And how much is still left that isn't affected, for example, contracts that haven't been priced, or discussions still to have, or areas where there is still sensitivity around the pricing?
So I think I would refrain from quantifying price increases for individual segments or sub-segments.
What I will say is that we have tried for the segments that are, or were subject to the price increase to allocate the increase across the segments in a way that would minimize the elasticity reaction.
And we so far feel like we've been pretty successful at doing that.
So the headline stamp price increase from EUR0.62 to EUR0.70 is more than 10% against an overall price increase of 7%.
So we allocated more there and less to other segments.
And again we think we've been pretty successful so far at doing that in a way that minimizes, to the extent possible, the volume reaction,
Okay, thanks very much.
Okay, Damian.
Sure.
Next caller please?
David Kerstens, Jefferies.
Hi, David.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
I have two questions on forwarding and freight please.
First, on forwarding you had a very strong improvement versus the first quarter, but if you adjust for the incidentals in the second half of last year your run rate remained relatively more stable.
Would you say that EUR50m is a reasonable assumption for the run rate for 2016?
Or what measures would you take to further improve profitability towards the margin target of at least 3% the former level?
And then the second question is regarding the road freight business.
What's driving the lumpy profitability?
You had a very encouraging improvement in the fourth quarter last year, but are now back at almost a breakeven result?
Thank you.
Yes, so on DGF first, I think we had a very good Q1.
It was the same profitability like we had seen the first quarter in 2014, which was actually before we started the transformation cycle.
We have improved and we will continue to improve further.
If you look into the detail, their first quarter was still on average very much impacted.
We had very strong growth in Q1 2015 that was positively impacted by the West Coast strike in the harbors.
And we of course had not started by then our more yield management approach, so therefore the difference is pretty large.
So we will expect that the gap to the previous year will close through the year.
We are confident that we can keep the margin.
We have taken a lot of costs out, not everything has materialized fully in the P&L, and that is a continuation through the year.
So we expect that we will continue to see a good improvement year over year.
On road freight their first quarter is a very weak quarter always for the freight business.
I think it's too early to judge.
We see very encouraging signs in most countries that we are heading in the right direction.
We had also some challenges in Eastern Europe through the Russia situation in particular, so overall I think we are on a very good trend.
But their first quarter is very weak and I think it will be -- or would be an over-interpretation to say that this is not going in the right direction.
I believe we are heading absolutely in the right direction and have seen good progress in freight as well.
Okay, thank you very much.
Do you have anything further?
Good.
No, that's fine.
Thank you.
Over to the next caller then.
Tobias Sittig, Mainfirst.
Yes, good afternoon, two buckets of questions for me.
Firstly, on market share how do you look at your market share performance both in mail and parcels in Germany?
Mail you're down 5.8%, your largest competitor has 6% revenue increase, so it's gaining share.
Do you see that as well happening, or how do you look at the market there?
In parcels the 7% growth is a bit a slowdown, but we had very strong numbers out of Belgium, out of the Netherlands.  [Anderson] grew 24% in international, so this sounds [that you] may have been losing some market share also in parcels, or how do you look at that?
And then on currency it feels a little bit like the currency hit that you had on the operating line, express, has moved to the financial line.
Is that what happened?
Or is that something different?
And following up on that your minority interests for DHL Sinotrans came off from EUR46m to EUR32m, so why is China profitability weaker in Q1 this year than last year?
So may I talk about the PeP thing?
So I saw the numbers as well, but all relatively low numbers, so if we have lost market share it is relatively little.
And of course it could be that some customer move as a combination from the strike and the price increase.
On parcels I think it's too early to say.
I think 7% is still a strong growth.
And we believe that we have gained market share now in four years, or three years at least in a row, and we are on a very healthy trend here as well.
I would say to conclude from just one quarter that we are growing slower than the market is probably an overstatement.
So we believe that we will continue with our service quality to gain market share as we have done before.
Yes, so let me take the two last questions.
So on currency I think it's good that you asked the question, it's a good question, because it's important to differentiate between the two different kinds of currency effects that we have.
So what we think of as the normal transaction and translation exposures that show up in operating cash flow and in EBIT continue to show up there.
But there is a special accounting regime for so-called hyper-inflation countries.
And here we think of countries like Venezuela, Argentina and Egypt.
And there for -- and only for those countries we recognize, in effect, mark-to-market gains and losses on hard-currency exposures in the balance sheet.
So if in one of those countries we have a US dollar credit or a loan, and there's a strong devaluation in the currency, we recognize that as a loss, but not an operating expense, rather in financial expense.
And we had some especially high exposures in Q1.
It bounces around from quarter to quarter.
We looked at the last number of quarters and we actually had some small gains in the middle of last year.
In the first quarter of last year we also had a loss, but smaller in Q1 of this year.
So I wouldn't expect that this is the beginning of a trend and that it will continue to result in minor volatility from quarter to quarter.
And it's important to differentiate between this kind of exposure and what we have in the operating income area.
So in minority interest in China we had a small one-time effect in the Q1 of last year and that just about entirely explains the evolution of the minority interest and the lower amount that we have in Q1 of this year.
Thank you.
So, Tobias, [can we consider your] question answered?
Good.
Yes.
Angus Tweedie, Bank of America.
Brilliant, thanks, guys.
Hi, Angus.
Just a couple of questions on PeP please.
Firstly, on the EUR34m provision in increase can you just talk about what's driving that?
Because shouldn't provisions decline over time with mail volumes?
And then on the Dialog marketing again I was wondering -- you flag local elections and Easter as a benefit.
Can you strip those out and give us an underlying decline figure there?
And then finally on the parcels it looks like revenue per unit was up quite strongly in Q1 on the German parcels.
Is that a price increase, or is it just mix effects?
Thanks.
Yes, let me try to tackle all three of those.
So, yes, the PeP provision that you're talking about is what we commonly call the stamp provision.
And it reflects the fact that in any given time period, in any given quarter in this case, that we sell more stamps than we provide service for or that are used.
And therefore we have revenue for services that we have not yet provided.
And in order to recognize that service that we have to provide in the future, because the stamps are already paid for, we increase the provision.
And that's exactly what happened in Q1 this year with the EUR34m increase in the provision.
And it was because we had a new -- we had a price increase and therefore new stamps.
And so everyone was stocking up their provision of the new, newly-priced stamps and therefore more stamps were sold than we provided service for.
And so we put the difference in the provision.
It's exactly the opposite of what happened in Q4 when everyone was using up their inventory of the old-priced stamps because they knew the price increase was coming and had already been announced.
So we saw probably more movement than usual in Q4 and now in Q1 than we would anticipate to see in most quarters.
And I would expect now the increase in the coming quarters, or decrease, for that matter, to be very small in comparison to what's happened in the last two quarters.
So, yes, parcel revenue per unit is reflecting a small price increase.
It's reflecting some mix effects as well, but overall a minor, but positive and very good, yield development for the parcel Germany business.
And, sorry, what was your question again on Dialog marketing?
It's just I think you highlight in the presentation that it was Easter and local elections for the reason it was flat on once adjusted for working days.
And I was wondering if you could quantify those.
Yes, I think there's always going to be some kind of special event, whether it's elections or some kind of event which is going to provide some movement one way or the other in volumes.
I don't think you can draw any conclusion from the fact that we did have some elections.
I think the Dialog marketing performance just was very good in Q1 and so we were pleased with that.
Dialog marketing, because it's a market where the customers have many different choices about how they spend their advertising expenses, it's one where really good marketing programs from our side and very good value propositions from our side result in good performance.
And that's what we've seen in Q1 of this year.
Let me add mainly as a reflection of our strategy 2020, where we say we want to be a quality leader, a quality leader should [come through their] price as well.
And I think we have focused significantly more in the last 12 months on growth management than we did before.
That's based on the improved service quality.
You can see that in express, mitigating currency headwinds quite well through yield management without losing traction on growth.
You see that in PeP that we've continued to grow strongly despite that we have an improvement in pricing.
You see that as well in DGF that our service quality is up.
We have grown in ocean freight and improved the margin.
At the same time, yes, we have been more selective on air freight and the target is now to get back to growth.
And also in supply chain we are looking very much in getting well paid for our great service quality we provide.
And I think that's what a market leader should do and we have done that in the last 12 months and probably more consistently than before.
And we will continue to do so back on our great service quality we're providing.
Okay, Angus, was that (multiple speakers)?
No, guys, thank you very much.
That's very helpful.
Good.
Okay, the next caller please?
Roger Elliott, [Citi].
Yes, good afternoon, everyone.
Hi, Roger.
Can I just ask two very short questions?
Firstly, was there anything in particular behind the growth spike you seem to have reported in your TVD volume in revenue per day in the first quarter?
And secondly one for Larry, I think.
Does the German tax project you referred to as being behind the reduction in tax guidance have any impact beyond 2015?
Yes, so first the second question first.
Answer is no.
It's more of a one-time impact this year.
So first question was the growth spike in TVD, where we indeed had some quite good performance.
This is reflecting more and more growth in what is still a small part of the express business, but a fast-growing part, and that is related to e-commerce, so people ordering products online that are being delivered across border.
And if they want to get a definite day delivery -- they don't necessarily need it by 10 o'clock in the morning the next day, but if they want to get it on a -- and make sure that they have it on a specific day then they may choose to order it by express.
And I think that is very much what's driving the good growth that we saw in TVD.
And is that across all the regions, or is there anywhere (inaudible)?
It's mostly Latin America, where we have quite a big TVD business in Mexico, and then Europe.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you, Roger.
And the next caller?
David Campbell, Thompson Davis & Co.
Yes, good afternoon everyone.
Thank you for taking the question.
One of your competitors has commented recently that their business in Europe taking -- or taking aside the seasonal effect of a poor -- normally seasonally-poor [fourth] quarter has remarked that business in Europe has been much longer for them than in the United States [for that].
And I think they were talking primarily about supply chain distribution and air freight exports.
It's -- I was just wondering what you have seen in your demand in Europe vis a vis the United States?
Yes, I think overall we are not seeing the -- an industry growth in Europe that's too much different from the US which is, in the areas of supply chain and, particularly, air freight, quite moderate.
The express business as well we think that the international express business is probably for industry growth quite similar in the US and in Europe, though we have been growing the last number of quarters generally faster in Europe.
But I think we've been gaining market share even more so than the US.
Q1 of this year we had quite a good growth quarter also in the US.
Okay, thank you very much, that's helpful.
Thank you, David.
And we've got time for a further caller or two?
Dominic Edridge, UBS.
Hello there, a couple of questions from myself.
Firstly, in terms of revenue growth, obviously, in terms of Group revenue you've highlighted you did 1.4% ex the fuel and FX.
And I'm just wondering, given obviously your targets for 2020 -- and I'm sure you'd want to see some acceleration in that for those targets to be met -- can you just discuss where you think the acceleration could really come from there?
Is it just a macro issue?
Or are there also some internal things that you will be highlighting that that's where we'll see better growth going forward?
And that's the first question, thanks.
Yes, so, if you're talking to the total picture so I think we were -- we are in a very good growth path for express and PeP and there are impacts from currencies and fuel and whatsoever, but underlying they have grown pretty nicely.
In DGF we have shrunk the top line quite a bit and that's mainly driven by freight rates and volumes in air freight.
As I already said, in ocean freight we are back to a growth with healthy development, but still the freight rates are down in ocean as they are down in air freight.
And in supply chain we believe as well that we can continue to grow, but again here with the change in the customary accounting, the revenue accounting for one customer, that has significant impact.
So we believe that the opportunity sits more in DGF and supply chain than in further growth in express and PeP, but they will continue on a very strong growth rate.
But as long as currency are -- we have headwind from currencies and lower fuel, or even declining freight rates, that the top-line number will not change too much, but the underlying volumes, and that should drive our profitability at the end of the day.
Okay, thanks, and then just one further question in terms of the -- maybe talk about tax and also the cash flow statement as a whole.
Larry, could you just say -- from what I understand the P&L tax tends to be impacted by these projects.
But from what I understand typically in Germany you will be already paying the minimum tax charge, so effectively should we assume that the cash tax side of things is much more stable year on year?
And then the second part is, given the other items that go between EBIT and operating cash flow, is there anything you can say to us at the moment that you'll be highlighting in terms of either provisions or other elements of what sort of quantum we should be looking at this year versus last year?
Thanks so much.
Okay.
Well, you're right that typically the cash tax payments are more stable than the P&L tax expense recognition.
That being said, it's worth noting that we do pay tax in Germany.
We have a relatively low effective tax rate in Germany, but of course we pay taxes in many other jurisdictions as well.
But again it's more stable compared to what we see on the P&L.
So in terms of the bridge from EBIT to operating cash flow I think -- I mentioned during the presentation the effect of the pension funding, the EUR1b funding that we've done at the beginning of Q2, which technically will go into our operating cash flow, and we exclude again from our guidance calculation.
But I think other than that you probably shouldn't affect -- expect any other or many other significant items compared to what we've seen historically.
Okay, thank you very much.
Thanks.
Thank you, Dominic.
And we're getting closer to the full hour so we may have time for maybe one follow-up question, operator.
Damian Brewer, Royal Bank of Canada.
Damian?
Good afternoon again, just one follow-on clarification just on the supply chain business.
I just wanted to clarify the long-term 2020 4.5% margin goal that's on the -- the rebased revenue outlook in terms of revenue recognition.
Yes, it is.
But again it's not 4.5%, it's 4.25%, and certainly our hope is to reach the upper end of that range.
Thanks very much.
Thank you, Damian.
And, operator, are there any further callers out there?
There are no further questions left.
Okay.
Well, then that concludes our Q&A round pretty much on time.
Thank you for that.
And for closing remarks may I hand over to Frank one more time.
Yes.
So overall of course if you tell -- we told you in autumn that we believe we're on the right track despite that we have some headwinds through some actions, being the strike or the change in direction in DGF.
We were very confident that we have the right measures in place and, of course, are very pleased now to see that these measures are delivering the value which we have promised.
So I believe very strongly that we are back on track on the right journey, as shown on the Page 1, where you saw the track record for many years.
We are now back on that line again and are very confident that we can deliver the 3.4 to 3.7.
So good start into the year and, of course, we will continue to work hard not only to gain market share, but also improve the margins further.
So thank you very much for listening and have a great day.
