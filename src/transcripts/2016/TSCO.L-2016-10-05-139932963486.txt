Half Year 2017 Tesco PLC Earnings Call (Debt Investor)
Hello and welcome to the Tesco PLC debt investor conference call.
(Operator Instructions)
Please note that this call is being recorded.
Today, I'm pleased to present CFO, Alan Stewart.
Please begin your meeting.
Thank you very much and good afternoon, everybody.
I'm joined here today by Lynda Heywood who has recently joined us as Tesco Group Treasurer.
She is going to be taking part of the introduction and then we will open to questions.
There is a deck which is on the website and we are going to be going through that.
If you want to follow it, I'll try and reference as we go through.
Given the degree of interest that I think there may be in asking questions, we are not going to spend too long on the presentation.
I'm conscious there's a number of you may also have watched it earlier on the webcast today.
If we turn into, really the things that we want to cover are the priorities that we set out last -- two years ago, the detailed results in brief, and then how we are building long-term value for our four key stakeholders.
That is something which we will come back to.
In terms of the priorities, we set them out in October, almost exactly two years ago.
David had been of the business for seven weeks, I had been in the business for four weeks.
We set out the intention to and the ambition to regain competitiveness in the UK, strengthen and protect the balance sheet and rebuild trust and transparency.
Over the last few years, we've seen a strong increase in the UK in the volume that we've sold.
This is the key measure we set ourselves on.
You can see from the graph on page 4 that since the low points of the second-quarter 2014, 2015, we've seen a strong and continuing increase and growth in like-for-like volumes.
That's really underpinning the recovery we're seeing.
Overall, we are more competitive in the UK, and we have lower prices from a customer perspective.
This is the basket that we talked to in terms of what shoppers buy.
We don't talk about big headline cost-saving initiatives, we look at it through a customer lens.
We've seen an increased 201,000 more customers shopping with us in the UK.
And if you look at that through another way in terms of switching from within the industry, we have seen positive from being a net donor to everybody in the industry, we are now in a position that we are gaining, and gaining from almost everybody in the industry.
The balance she has been significantly strengthened, it's more secure.
We're generating cash, we generated GBP800 million of reduction in net debt in the first half of this year.
Overall, our net debt is GBP4.4 million, which as I've said, is lower.
We also bought back a number of properties which is important for the long-term security of the business and the health of the business.
Our group-owned property has increased by 5 percentage points from 50 to 55.
And in the UK it's even higher, from 41 to 48, so 7 percentage points there.
We also closed the fund benefit pension scheme and have introduced a DC scheme.
But first, in terms of the competitiveness in the UK and the strength of the balance sheet, we feel we've met those.
Trust and transparency, this is an index which we've looked at and pointed to a number of times.
And you can see from, again, the low point in the middle of 2014, we are now above where we were.
Importantly, if you look at it relative to others in the sector, we're beginning to get closer to that.
We feel good progress in all three of those.
In terms of the half-year results, I'm really not going to spend a lot of time on them.
The group performance is one which is set out above.
We have, overall, at constant rates we've seen sales increase of 1.3%.
We had some benefit from currency but, overall, 1.3%.
Our operating profit is up nearly 60% before exceptional items.
In the half, it's just under GBP600 million.
We have a few exceptionals and we are -- which we will call out whenever there is something which is large or significant.
This GBP81 million includes an element of the -- both credit and some costs.
But the principle is that we try to run the business without exceptionals.
If we then turn to the segmental performance, we saw growth across all parts of our business, the UK and the Irish segment, the international segments in the Bank all grew.
We also saw strong growth in the operating profit in the UK and Ireland.
A slight decline internationally.
Only GBP4 million, which translates into a GBP10 million drop and the Bank a slight increase in terms of operating profit and at constant rate, as I said, a slight increase in terms of the reported statutory numbers.
If We then move lower down the P&L and we get to finance, income and costs.
Overall net finance costs were down around GBP40 million year on year and GBP246 million -- I'm now on page 8 of the presentation -- driven by some moving parts.
Interest payable increased as we brought debt onto our balance sheet and having bought back some property assets, and reduction in net pension finance costs offsetting that.
And finance income increasing, partly as a result of the interest we earned from the cash receipts in sale of our Korean business.
Underlying cash costs of finance is around GBP203 million and below that GBP246 million.
Tax, we've seen the tax charge for the year effective rate at 28% for the half-year, which is a reduction from last year's half.
Overall, we expect the full-year effective tax rate to be around 25%.
Cash cost of tax is around GBP17 million underlying that.
As we seek to close off earlier years with the revenue, we are getting some cash payments back in terms of overpayment in respect to the earlier years.
I've mentioned the exceptional items, GBP95 million of restructuring and redundancy, of which GBP22 million is in the Bank, the balance in the UK and Irish business.
We provided another GBP45 million in the Bank for customer redress, primarily the PPI finally coming to an end, plus some provisions for the Severn judgment.
And then we gained GBP59 million from the sale of properties, which were exceptional credits.
In terms of the pension scheme on slide 11, we've reduced the pensions scheme and we believe that is, in the long run, the right decision for the health of the business.
We look at it very much not from an IAS 19 perspective.
The way we think about this was set up fairly with the Trustees and look to the long-term framework designed to give predictability of deficit payments, and to look through pension trial and evaluations and to cope with market fluctuations.
So once the IAS 19 deficit has increased very significantly, and I think it's worth remembering that there is no change in the underlying cash commitments which will fall due over many, many years, many decades, as the scheme reaches maturity and then begins to get to the run-off stage.
We made very good progress with de-risking the assets investment side of that, and we've also seen a strong performance in scheme assets in the six months.
They're up 28%.
A lot's going well but the IAS 19 measure has increased.
We have the deficit funding plan which we are going to the Trustees, that is in place.
And [other words] we make GBP270 million per annum of a cash contribution.
We'll look at it again next year, off the March 2017 actuarial data and what the view of the assets and liability is at that stage.
But it will be very much driven through the framework that we set up with the Trustees, and certainly not driven by the IAS 19 measurement.
In terms of net debt, we've spoken before about how we seek to run the business on a cash-generating basis.
We generated GBP850 million of cash from operations.
We then generated another GBP110 million or so from the working capital movements and the cash cost of exceptionals, giving GBP955 million of cash from operations.
A little bit from the sale of the Turkish business which is discontinued in these results gives us GBP964 million.
And then we paid interest and tax of GBP220 million.
CapEx spend of GBP540, giving free cash flow of GBP203 million.
We then generated GBP292 million from the sale of Harris & Hoole and the Dobbies business.
And we also generated GBP236 million from the sale of the properties, which gives a reduction in net debt of GBP758 million for the period.
The final slide before I hand over to Lynda is just to look at our total indebtedness.
These figures are ones which we've very clearly spoken about over the last two years.
I think it's important that we think about them as having very, very different underlying characteristics.
So the net debt, which is reduced from GBP8.6 billion down to GBP4.4 billion, is the combination of our own balance sheet, bonds, any overdrafts and Bank borrowings we have, offset by cash in the business.
So, a significant reduction, and as I said, GBP800 million improvement in the half-year.
The lease commitments are much longer.
They're, if you like, pay-as-you-go commitments.
We're seeking to reduce the potential impact of those increasing over time as we buy back properties.
And they are pretty stable across the year from the half -- this year back to the beginning of the year.
But year on year they're down GBP9.1 billion to GBP7.8 billion.
And define the pension deficits which we've spoken about, which is a much longer-term commitment and will run over many, many years, many decades.
I'll now hand over to Lynda before going into the forward-looking part of the presentation.
Hello, everyone.
On page 14 now, building on that total indebtedness profile, we set out here the metrics that we look at internally.
But working in line with credit rating agency metrics, and we've included capitalization for you in the appendix after this pack.
All three metrics show improvement since this time last year, and the permission [syncs] are year-end on the total investments ratio is impacted by the pension scheme valuation that Alan discussed just now.
Net debt EBITDA, which doesn't include pension, all these sets have improved since year-end.
Over time, we would expect these ratios to improve as we move towards investment-grade and they'll be driven by business performance.
On our credit rating, rates stabilized.
We show you here our rating with all three agencies.
Fitch became the latest agency to revise our outlook to stable in April of this year following our prelim.
We have a [fifth dial-up] with the rating agencies, something that I will be looking to build on.
And the agencies have given us clear expectations of what is needed for an upgrade.
We have included this chart here on page 16 of our guest performance.
The market's also reflecting our total lands.
Our CPS level appears to be decoupling from the iTraxx Crossover Index and starting to show less volatility.
Moving on to liquidity, the Group's in strong liquid position with available cash of GBP5.2 billion.
We've committed facilities of GBP5 billion following the successful refinancing of GBP1.8 billion of bilateral facilities and the extension to 2021 of our revolving credit facility.
Significant debt repayments of GBP1.9 billion becomes due in half-two of this year.
Actually we've already paid GBP1.2 billion of those in September with a further GBP1.5 billion maturing next financial year, so a total of GBP3.4 billion over the next 18 months.
Our policy is to retain a prudent liquidity buffer of cash and committed facilities to allow flexible working capital and of contingency.
On slide 18 we give you a snapshot of that maturity profile so you can see the shape of our expanding debt.
We have a good distribution of maturity, but with a number coming up in the short-term, which are those that I've alluded to just now, in terms of our uses of cash.
Finally for me, we've summarized our debt facilities and programs just here in one place for you.
As you can see, we have GBP5 billion of undrawn committed facilities, as well as a number fronting programs at our disposal.
And of our gross balance sheet debt of GBP11 billion, you can see the split there between sterling and [TN], euro and TN, dollars and our secured debt.
Now I'm going to hand back to Alan for some continued remarks strategic drivers.
Thanks, Lynda.
From the messages of the market today, I think the one which certainly coming from the analysts and the market, commentary this morning, and perhaps, you can see it reflected in our share price, we have today given some view as to, not only the outlook, but also the way we've been running the business and how we think about the business as we now move from this period of initial crisis through stabilization and into the recovery period.
The lenses that we look through are, as I say, ones that we have been looking at for some time, and they are the key stakeholders.
They are the colleagues, the customers, the suppliers and the shareholders.
And within those lenses, we're running the business looking at six strategic drivers.
I'll cover each of those in turn and talk through them.
The first is a differentiated brand.
We fundamentally believe that a brand differentiation is something which creates longer-term and gives us a stronger position.
There's a lot of work which we can point to which shows why that's the case.
The brand guarantee is designed to look at the elements that are comparable across the business.
We equally think that a differentiated brand gives us the ability to really focus on what Tesco does separately.
The elements of that are some of them you've seen in terms of in-store UK competitiveness and that we set them all out on slide 21, is the range, the service, the price, the quality of the product, that really is our areas that we'll look at.
You can also get things which customers value, like Clubcard.
You can get F&F only at Tesco.
And we have Tesco Bank and Tesco Mobile which are important business which form part of the overall brand.
So building a differentiated brand is the first driver we'll be looking at and talking about the business through looking forward.
We then have also set out the ambition to reduce our operating costs.
We weren't competitive against the market two years ago.
We've made a lot of progress in improving that competitiveness but there is more to do.
And helping underpin that improved competitiveness is really looking at the costs that we have.
So, each of these three broad areas, roughly a third each of the GBP1.5 billion savings we've set out, we have programs and we are targeting savings from the store operating model, whether it's in the way we run the stores, when we open the stores, how we deal with in-store activity, we're targeting around GBP550 million of savings over the course of this period.
We've got about GBP450 million targeted in logistics and distribution, again, an area where the flow of stock, how we handle stock incurs cost.
And if that's not cost which is beneficial to the customer, then we really will try and reduce it to a minimum wherever possible.
Finally an area that we haven't really focused on before is the area of goods and services not for resale where we're targeting about GBP500 million.
This is the spend which is made within Tesco for Tesco, nothing to do with customers and nothing to do with anything other than the way we run the business.
So we're looking to centralize that and looking to take around GBP500 million of cost savings in that area.
The cash generation is something which, from an external target perspective, people began to think about when we published our annual report.
It's obviously underpinned.
We were able to generate GBP9 billion of cash over this year and the next two years beyond that.
It's obviously underpinned by some of the margin improvement.
There is a stock reduction program, which again flows into the working capital of GBP400 million.
Finally, we've really tried to demonstrate over the last two years that we have a very strong capital discipline.
We're looking at where we are spending the money, how we are spending it, what returns we're getting.
We do post investment reviews.
And then the CapEx, we look at the right level.
We've set out a CapEx targets of reconfirming this year GBP1.25 billion, which is consistent which with what we set out in April.
And over the next three years beyond that, we aim to average around GBP1.4 billion per annum of CapEx.
The fourth element that we will talk about is maximizing the mix of business.
And without going into a lot of detail, some of which we went into this morning, we really look at it through the different areas of the geography.
A country might be generating a higher margin today than the average for the group.
Equally, another one might be generating a lower margin.
As we seek to improve performance in those countries, so we will improve the overall group operating margin.
Channel is the other area.
So whether it's online or large stores, convenience or metros, we look at it through channel.
Then finally, of course, is the product and category element of the overall margin.
Each of those lenses are ones which we look to improve the operating margin and again by the cost savings we have already spoken about.
We've begun to show how we will look at a property and how we will not only reduce -- improve the business performance to rental insulation.
What we've done in terms of property as already insulated us from around GBP120 million of potential rentals which we won't have to face going forward.
We are looking at wherever possible, how we can generate in conjunction with partners, and value from some of the assets that we have in terms of profits.
And then as you have seen in first half, wherever we can see there's value to be gained, we will sell property.
So, the GBP240 million, a large part of that was, for instance, in check.
In public earlier this year we sold Emall and Cold Liver Ranch.
And we'll continue to look at other opportunities to maximize the value from property.
Finally, and importantly, but this is one which we are not going to talk about much in terms of what's coming down the line because it is comparatively sensitive.
And the sum of what we've done in terms of innovation of the brand guarantee belongs to food brands in the first half of this year.
We've got a very strong focus on food waste.
We've got commitments which we been very public on, and we're very pleased with how we're doing on those.
And then we've also spoken about some of the technology aspects.
This is a payment mechanism whereby you can pay electronically thought an electronic wallet.
It's absolutely linked to your Clubcard and it's an area where we believe that there is some opportunity.
There's more to come in that area but we're not going to talk about it.
So that's really where we are in terms of the first half, the move from the three priorities into the forward-looking parts of the business.
I'm very happy to take any questions now.

Toby Hunston, Insight Investments.
Hi, thanks very much for taking my questions.
I've got three on my side.
Firstly, in terms of with the leverage now a bit higher year on year, have you talked with the rating agencies before these results?
Or will you be in the next few days to make sure that's all comfortable at BB+?
Second question is in terms of, could I double check that it's a 7% discount rate that you are using to get to the GBP7.8 billion on leases?
And with IFRS 16 coming in, how much you expecting that present value of leases to rise by.
Is that in the order of GBP1.5 billion, GBP2 billion?
Or is that wildly wrong?
Then thirdly, if you've got an expectation off from self-guidance for the full-year working capital move, that would be very useful.
Thank you.
Toby, hi.
I'll answer the second third and let Lynda talk about discussions of the rating agencies.
In terms of 7%, yes, you're absolutely right, it is.
As regards IFRS 16, it's fiendishly complex when you get into it.
We're busy working through what it means.
I'm not in a position, I'm afraid, to give you an answer on the numbers that you are looking at.
What we do know is that it's going to change the balance sheet, the P&L, but not the cash.
But not only are the -- going forward once it implements, the way in which you and we choose to implement it, potentially impacts on those.
So, very early days.
But with around 3,000 leases around the world to look at, putting aside any operating leases within the business, there's a lot that we need to look at.
As soon as we have more information we can give you more but for the moment, you're right, it's 7%.
As regards working capital, we haven't given the target for the full year.
We continue to focus on it.
It is an area that we are looking to continue to make improvements.
And we are focused on running the business on a cash-generative basis so that the year-end debt is lower, net debt is lower by end of all the outgoings and what we've generated than we were at the start of the year.
I'll let Lynda deal with rating agencies.
I will talk about rating agencies, although I am conscious that they are actually participating in this call.
I, personally, in my first two months in the business have had contact with all three agencies.
We have an ongoing dialogue with them.
And we also have planned contact after today's result.
So we are joined up with them.
As to how they're feeling about the results, I think I need to have that contact with them and we will know more then.
Okay, thank you.
Could I just have one quick follow up on the leases?
Presumably, there's no way the preview of leases is going to go down at all, given the discount rate?
There's no way the discount rate can be higher than 7%?
I'm afraid I don't really know that.
We've chosen 7% as being consistently applied.
I don't know, Toby, why it really changes things at all.
But we've got no plans to change that discount rate at the moment.
Okay, thank you.
(Operator Instructions)
Philip McCartney, Royal Bank of Canada.
Thank you, good afternoon.
Thanks for the call.
It was just going back to the rating agencies.
You said they've given clear guidelines for an upgrade, in terms of your own forecast.
So where on that journey do you think you are?
When might it be realistic to hit those thresholds for an upgrade?
And then a couple of more detailed questions.
You said this morning you wanted to be an investment-grade issuer.
Does that mean you'd wait for an upgrade before you came back to the market for issuance?
Or am I reading a bit too much into that?
And, finally, whether you considered any liability management, or whether you're comfortable with a net debt roll-off with your level of liquidity at the moment?
Gosh, there are a number questions in there.
In terms of we do have a view on timing but we don't share it.
And the reason we don't share it is that because the hard metrics, if you like, we can absolutely calculate, and we have a view, as would you.
But then each of the agencies has their own qualitative metrics as well.
I think for us to get those would not be helpful.
So, we clearly know what each of the rating agencies look to and we continue -- so there is a bit of noise on the line.
We continue each of those discussions, but really wouldn't want to give a prediction on it as to when that is.
But we do have our own view.
As regards -- there's no reason why we couldn't issue as a sub-investment-grade.
We've been very clear on that.
And if you look at all-in costs of that issuance, depending on the tenor, it may well be that we would be issuing at lower than what we were maturing as well.
But there's no reason then, and we do believe that there would be demand if that were to be the case.
But again, we're not making any specifics as regards to the market.
And then liability management is something which we think about and we will continue to think about.
But again, from a market perspective, you wouldn't expect us to be saying any more than that.
Okay, thank you.
[Ella Coutou], JPMorgan.
Hello, thank you very much for taking my questions.
I have two, please.
The first one is on the property.
You've been buying back your properties.
Is there a target rate you want to hit in the UK or overall as a group?
The second question is on the cash level.
Given that you have cash maturity, bond maturities, coming up and you had about GBP2.5 billion of cash in the retail business, what's the minimum level of cash you would like to see on the balance sheet, please?
Thank you.
Okay, in respect to embedded as short-term property, no there isn't a target.
What we were clear on when we set out is that we were lower than we wanted to be.
And we do continue to look at them.
There's a pretty rigorous set of stats that we look at.
It starts very much with the question we ask ourselves is, is this a store which we want to be trading from and expect to be trading from for the very long term?
If the answer to that is, yes, next question is do we own it?
If the answer to that is no, then we're into a potential store buyback.
We then get to if they're a willing seller.
And is that seller willing to sell it at a price which we think is the right price for the asset.
It absolutely is, to a large degree, outside our control.
But we are focused on increasing it within those conditions.
We have said, and we said this morning, there are further two stores which we would expect to be buying back in the second half of this year.
That's around GBP100 million of commitment.
And if others come up, then we will talk about it.
But looking forward, that's where we are.
In respect of the liquidity and the cash, we have a level.
There's, within our balance sheet, there's clearly some till and similar cash which is effectively always there and needs to be treated as a float.
And as Lynda said, we have some liquidity buffer.
But we haven't said publicly what that is.
We run it on a basis which we think is prudent in a business which is operationally good.
Thank you.
Lisa McLaughlin, Fidelity Management and Research.
Hi, thank you.
Most of my questions have already been answered.
I guess the one remaining for me is the impact of Brexit and how you're thinking about that, both in terms of FX risk and in hedging and international sourcing and food inflation.
Lisa, it's a good question.
When we go back to the pre-Brexit scenario, what we clearly identified with, there were some areas where there could be an impact and ForEx was definitely one of them.
Importantly, what we found and felt and continue to believe is that we would not be competitively disadvantaged by any of those potential out-turns and impact.
So relative to others in the UK market, we wouldn't be competitively disadvantaged, and that remains the case.
With regards to the specifics of whether -- it's absolutely the case that if we're buying goods which are in a foreign currency, they will cost more now in sterling because of sterling devaluation.
But we're focused on improving the offer and competitiveness to our customer.
We want to work with suppliers and that way we start with trying to mitigate any of those cost pressures internally before we look at it from a customer perspective.
We equally will want to be competitive in the market.
And we do have hedging programs.
We've got hedging programs which are within our treasury policies, and as you'd expect, as I guess everybody in the industry has.
And we've taken a view within those policies of the appropriate level of hedging.
So, it is an uncertainty but it's not one which we believe causes any competitive disadvantage.
Okay, thank you.
And in terms of lower yields, clearly put an impact on your pension deficit.
Is there anything of a lower yield environment that changes the bang and the freeholds out of the attractiveness of that to you?
Or your seller's willingness to exit these properties?
Not specifically, no.
They tend to be very property-specific, or owner-specific is probably the better way to look to it.
The factors are owner-specific, the factors are it may be that there are other things happening.
And if you go back to some of the transfers we made last year, they were much more linked to that.
So I don't think lower yields per se change the decision.
One of the things which I've said before and I think remains the case, is that as yields get compressed, so investors look for other return-seeking assets or seek returning assets.
That tends to give some underpin to the property markets, which is perhaps, a bit artificial compared with other structural factors in it.
There's probably a bit more of an underpin to them, but it's very difficult to prove that correlation between the two.
And as we've seen in the commercial property world in the last couple of months, there's been some movement there, but no significant change.
What you've seen is some buyers are shifting and others are coming in.
Okay, thank you.
(Operator Instructions)
Toby Hunston, Insight Investments.
Another one, Toby.
Sorry about this.
It's on a different subject, thankfully, so at least you won't get bored.
It's on the secured debt that you've got, the GBP1.5 billion there in the pie chart.
I just wanted to confirm that part of that is what's popularly known in the market as the Delmar or Delamare Bonds.
And the GBP630 million or so loans -- well, in inter-Company loans/bonds?
Yes, it's the onset, yes.
Yes, because that's the part of what you bought back last year, correct?
Given that we now own the properties, on one level what we've looked at is we're not going to transfer value into the market just in order to decouple owned properties that we now own from certain debts.
In that sense it makes sense for us to continue the funding behind them.
But we always look to those sort of assets.
And in the same way as the earlier question was around do we look at liability management, so we look at everything in the round.
But absolutely the short answer is yes, it's part of that.
Okay, fair enough.
And then a follow-on question.
I guess that presumably means that the properties under that are particularly good-performing assets that you're happy with.
Then, whether you would ever look to take out the attached debt so that you have those assets unencumbered?
The fact that they are encumbered doesn't really cause us any problem because we start with the fact we want to own them and operate from for the long-term.
The one thing I'm very loath to do, to transfer value from us into the market just because there is a structure in place.
Okay, understood.
But presumably they are pretty good assets relative to those group (multiple speakers).
Yes, wee -- exactly.
If you think back to the first criterion I set out was is it an asset which we want to trade from for the very long term?
Implicit in that is the assumption that it will always be -- is the element of this being a store which is performing well and therefore we expect to be trading from it for the long term.
If that's what you call a good asset, then they are good assets.
Okay, got it.
Thank you very much.
Brian Barry, Wells Fargo.
I apologize if it's been asked already, but just a general question on the pricing environment.
Have you noticed any changes over the last weeks, months with respect to other players?
And then another question would be your price positioning.
Do you have an idea of where you stack up against discounters and your other big four competitors?
Brian, I absolutely understand the questions.
As a matter of general policy, we don't comment on others in the market.
We have, today, in terms of the overall detailed presentation, we've shown some of the relativities without naming any competitors.
Some of those were quantitative.
They were customer measures off our spotlight where we've shown how two years ago we were at the bottom of a seven-table comparative, and we are now either at the joint top or number three in two of qualitative measures from customers.
Specifically, as against your question on price, we did set out in terms of the farm brands, the relativity over the period since launching farm brands.
And we've shown that in respect to those, we've been price competitive against the other -- I think there were five others on that chart.
So, we're really focused on remaining competitive, and we will be competitive in the market.
I suppose the other thing, perhaps implicit in your question is, is there inflation inherent anything in it?
The answer is, we're not planning and relying on inflation in terms of pricing.
We need and will remain competitive because that's what really gives us the advantage.
That's what gave us the 201,000 extra customers we have seen.
Okay, I guess, I mean, what I was trying to get at actually was, in the first question, was there's been a lot of talk about Asda price cuts.
Have you noticed anything yet?
Or is it very much a matter of just left talk, no actual follow-through yet?
What we've said, and then I don't really want to talk about anybody specifically, but what we've done is we have made the cuts that we need.
We've seen in the meat and the produce element, the value and the volume increase, and we've seen good growth.
We've made our plans based on market conditions as we see them, and we do look and continue to look to that relativity.
We do think that our behavior is rational, and that's what we will be.
We will be rational.
But we will also be competitive.
There's been a lot of talk.
We will always focus on those baskets rather than big headline numbers.
And equally, we are focused on stable pricing, which our customers know and trust, and which we deliver through time and over an extended period of time.
And that's really why, I think, if you look at that on the graph we spoke about in terms of the UGo brand measure, we've seen that consistent increase from what was a very low point.
But it's over time the consistency of price and the delivery of that competitively is what's needed.
Yes, there may be others out there.
Their actions, they know much better than we do what they'll be.
But we are focused on delivering that competitive price to customers.
Okay, thank you.
Charles Watford, PIMCO.
Hi, thanks, very much.
Just a few questions from me.
First of all, on the cost savings, the GBP1.5 billion that you talked about, is that an annualized figure?
Or is that cumulative over the three years?
That's cumulative over the three years, Charles.
Okay.
So GBP500 million a year is how I should think about it?
If you want to, then its accumulative to that.
But it's obviously in layers as you build them.
And what we have said though, is that we expect -- and this is within the press release, we do expect it to be weighted more towards the benefits to be seen more towards the back end of the period as we see the overall elements coming through.
Sorry, maybe I misspoke, but the EBITDA of GBP2.1 billion.
If I think about it as a cost saving being taken out GBP1.5 billion, are you saying that it, at the end of three years, would be GBP2.6 billion, assuming 100% drop-through?
Or GBP3.6 billion?
Obviously you would lose a lot of that, but I'm just -- see how it comes through.
I'm not sure I'm understanding.
Sorry, I'm not sure I'm understanding your question, Charles.
Should the costs that you plan to take out of GBP1.5 billion -- .
By the end they would have accumulated that.
But the other thing that really there is important and that one anybody could go away not having had this message given to them, is that we are going to use these to invest in the offer.
I understand.
And deliver the margin improvement, so there are many elements to this.
But, yes, you can't -- but as you have expressed it, that's fair.
If you like, it's more of a self-help.
It's intent generated benefit which we then can transfer to customers as value which they receive and some which we can transfer to the stakeholders in terms of the business, which is the increase in the margin.
Okay, thanks, very clear.
Secondly, on pensions.
On this morning's call you expressed quite a bit of confidence around the GBP270 million being the cash costs, and actually, going on beyond the 2018, or 2017 tri-annual review, have you already had discussions with the Trustees about continuing it at that GBP270 million?
And then, the second part of the pensions question, if I look at the discount rate, I notice you are using 2.1%.
Given the change in yield since August 27, if we applied today's to that, would it be GBP600 million lower?
I guess we've had a 20 basis points move in rates and therefore mechanically going to the annual report, it would seem the number would move around by GBP600 million.
I think what we -- specifically to your question as asked, set up as the sensitivity, I think it's about GBP530 million for every 10 basis points.
And today the metric, if we look at the up and down within the notes to the interim we've spoken about.
It's around GBP500 million for each 10 basis points.
Much more importantly, though, is that I really don't believe that it's a relevant measure in terms of what we're looking at, which is the cash flows.
And specifically to your question as regard to the Trustees, we have a continuing dialogue with the trustees.
We really talk to them very regularly; I will talk to them at the results meeting.
And what we set out of the 2014 numbers, and around 18 months ago now, what we set out was a very clear framework which as designed to give a path from the Trustees and some elements of stability as we went through changing market conditions, and as we went through tri-annual valuations.
The fact that the yield today, which is a very, very artificial measure, from being the IAS 19 measure.
As we go through that, the framework that we set out is that which we are taking into that valuation.
So, I don't want to prejudge the valuation, but I absolutely know what we and the Trustees set out to do was to create a framework which would deliver GBP270 million on a continuing basis.
There are a number of different valves that we look at that.
There are four different ones; I'm very happy to talk about this more.
But the one that immediately, without changing any of the other valves, would address any issues, is to make the GBP270 million payable from longer than is currently envisioned.
That seems to me a much better way to deal with changing conditions than to change other elements and to disrupt what was set out as a stable and predictable cash flow mechanism.
We'll see what it is.
It will be measured off March next year.
And I think the final thing I'd say is that there is no change in any of this to the cash flows which a pension member will receive, these payoffs each year for many, many, many years hence.
So, were talking about measuring something at a very single point in time, very far removed from a number of the cash flows of a highly, highly sensitive mechanism.
Understood.
Just a couple more quick ones.
Loss-making areas, you had a good slide in this morning's deck saying that you'd effectively stopped investing in any area which was loss-making.
Do you still have many loss-making areas now that you're out of Turkey, Harris & Hoole, et cetera?
No, no we haven't.
No, is the answer.
Okay.
And then an earlier question on sterling depreciation.
You've -- given most food retailers saw something like 50% of their products were produced from the Euro zone.
Should we be expecting somewhere in the order of 6% to 8% food price inflation after Christmas?
Look, I think I covered that earlier on Charles in terms of the answer.
We look to try to mitigate any changes.
But equally, if they are there and we work with our suppliers, we don't believe we'll be competitively disadvantaged.
And we want to be competitive within the market.
So timing specifically, very difficult to know.
People have put different hedging programs.
Equally, you can source from different areas.
So very early to say.
And I certainly wouldn't go to that degree of specificity.
But you would expect to see some sort of price -- the market go from deflation to inflation in the next 12 months?
No, no were not saying that at all.
And I really am not going to give that sort of prediction.
(laughter) fair enough.
We're happy with where we are.
We believe that we -- that we offer better.
There is more we can do on competitive, we plan to become more competitive.
The deflation is something which actually we think is the right thing from a customer perspective.
More deflation would be good rather than bad.
Understood.
Thank you.
As there are no further questions, I will return the conference to you.
Great.
Thanks, very much, everybody.
No doubt, you will spend more time talking to Lynda and the team in Treasury.
But thank you very much for your continued support and your interest today.
Look forward to talking next time.
This now concludes our conference call.
Thank you all for attending.
