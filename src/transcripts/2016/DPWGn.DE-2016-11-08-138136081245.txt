Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Deutsche Post DHL conference call regarding the third quarter results of 2016.  (Operator Instructions).
Let me now turn the floor over to your host, Mr.
Martin Ziegenbalg.
Well thank you, and good afternoon everyone out there to our Q3 2016 conference call.
We are going to follow the usual pattern.
So I've got Frank Appel, our CEO with me and our CFO, Melanie Kreis.
They're both going to take you through the presentations that I take it you have in front of you.
And after that, we are happy to deal with your questions.
And without further ado, over to you Frank.
Yes, thank you Martin.
As well, good afternoon or good morning from my side.
I'm very pleased to explain a little bit the highlights of the quarter as much as the growth agenda and then Melanie will talk a little bit more about the financial numbers.
So let's go to page 3 of the presentation.
You're used to that page on the left side at least, where we last year said that 2015 will be a year of transition and 2016 will significantly better and we gave a guidance already a while ago that we want to deliver EUR3.4 million to EUR3.7 million EBIT this year.
We are well on our way.
Q3 confirmed all the progress we have made in all divisions and I'm very pleased about the progress, because it's pretty consistent across the board.
So, PeP is continuing to grow, the parcel business in Germany and the investments into the international parcel business are getting traction now.
Express is continuing and enlarging their margins and is growing above the market.
The turnaround in DGFF is progressing, and we are well on our way with the IT renewal roadmap.
Supply chain, very strong performance in the Q3, which is based on the strategic measures John Gilbert and his team has taken.
So overall, we can reconfirm today that we are on the right path to deliver our strategy 2020.
We have -- our structure growth trends are behind us, which is e-commerce on one and, of course, the capabilities also will help us to continue our growth rate as well in the future.
So overall, we are well on track for 2016 and beyond.
On page 4 you see what it means for the volume and revenue growth for parcel in PeP.
It's double digit now.
We had a very strong quarter.
Revenue growth is even higher than parcel growth.
That shows that we are also looking to yield in this area.
We have very strict discipline as well on cost of course to drive profitability.
This is now the third year in a row that we see an increase in volume growth, as you see on the bottom left.
And that's above what we promised or suggested as a growth rate of the market in 2014.
If you go to page 5, very good development as well on the mail side.
We have revenue increase in the third quarter for our communication, a slight decrease in dialog marketing.
That's a reflection of the overall market trends you see.
If you look onto the bottom left, as we said, we will see a normalization of a decline in the mail products this year.
And we are now very close again to the range we had predicted years ago already as minus 2% to 3%.
Significantly, less decline than last year when we had a strike, so we are very confident that we will get to the same range as predicted originally going forward.
We also have some flexibility on pricing for business customers after we had concluded on a significant stamp price increase this year, which is stable until 2018.
But we have some possibilities to reduce the discount rate and that should give us some help next year.
If you look on page 6 that shows you on one hand the nice growth we see in parcel revenue in Europe and in e-commerce.
So we are getting traction here all over the place.
Our network covers now 18 countries.
And we'll cover very soon, if we add Portugal and Iberia, 20.
And if the proposed acquisition is successful in the UK, then we will even have 21 countries.
So we see very good developments also outside of Europe via the US where we see good growth in India where our business is developing well.
And also our start-up in Thailand is what -- with regard to the volume growth, ahead of our expectations, so PeP is doing well.
Coming to Express on page 7, another quarter where we have seen healthy growth, which is now at about 7% in the quarter and revenue growth is more than 5%, which is definitely a reflection as well of new development and currencies and whatsoever, so overall very good development.
You see on the bottom left we are well above the expected market growth of 5% to 6%, and that for many years we -- you see as well the pattern.
This time we had a strongest growth in Americas.
And Europe, as you might remember, that moved around the world continuously.
Asia Pacific was the least growing region this quarter, but it might change again in the next quarter.
So with regard to B2C, and we explained that at the recent market tutorial, we are gaining also here significant volume.
And that will help us to grow even -- but to continue our growth above the market growth going forward.
You might ask if B2C gets larger, that might be a threat for the profitability.
As you will see later, it had so far no impact.
It helped us to enlarge our margin and to continue to grow our absolute EBIT.
And the reason is shown on page 8.
Many indicators are supportive of our business model.
For instance, the weight per shipment is lower than on average.
The revenue per kilo is higher.
On the first mile, we have higher density for pickup than in normal businesses.
The only challenge we have is on the last mile.
Of course, if you go to private households, then you have less parcels per drop.
We are now working on that with the system where intensive communication between the consignee and us can happen.
That has helped us already to manage the cost on the last mile in a better way to have successful first deliver -- first attempts for delivery, for instance.
And if I look into our cost for pickup and delivery, we see that this is slightly down even per piece.
That means this is well under control.
And that's the reason why we have seen a continuation of good margin in absolute EBIT development.
On page 9, you see now the global forwarding and freight.
We had in air freight the first quarter since a while, since earlier 2015, that we see growth in air freight in a quite difficult market at the moment.
More encouraging is the growth we have seen in ocean freight and you will see in a second also very profitable.
So, nevertheless, I think it's good that we grow again in both products, because that's a reflection of the service quality at the end of the day.
On the bottom left, you see that we have missed the market growth for a while.
These lines are the long-term growth trends we expect.
We believe that ocean is not growing with 4% to 5% this year, but less than 3% and therefore we believe that we have done pretty well in ocean freight this year.
Air freight, as I said, the first growth quarter since a while despite that the market is not very supportive.
On page 10, you see what I've just described on air freight.
That has impact on the gross profit.
Despite that we were able to turnaround from shrinking volume to an increase in volume again.
That has not materialized in the absolute gross profit, so we still have to do some work here.
Ocean freight very encouraging.
Even the growth in gross profit is faster than in the volumes, which shows that we have a good market position.
And that encouraged me as well that we should see a good development for the division as well.
We are globally capable to provide great service for our customers.
On the bottom left on page 10 you see that the gross profit, the absolute gross profit, if you take all quarters together, we are not far away from where we have been.
The conversion rate is still down, and that is definitely what we call internal measures.
We should be able to improve the margin going forward again to a level what we have seen.
And then on top of that, of course, the change in our AT landscape should help us beyond the original conversion rate to improve it further until 2020.
Supply chain as last on page 11.
We see growth if you take the accounting change for NHS out and currencies and whatsoever.
We are not on market growth level yet, but what we see is that we see good development, or profitable growth here.
So we have been much more selective.
And that is now achieved and therefore I'm optimistic that we can close the gap again going forward to the market.
Signings are on a good track as well to deliver significantly more than EUR1 billion again this year.
So overall, supply chain is, I think, on the right path and we are getting traction from the strategic actions we have taken.
On page 12, you see the split.
We are pretty active in all industries with very different solutions.
And I think that's a core strength that we have world-class operations in many sectors and therefore we can benefit from the growth in many sectors.
So before I hand over to Melanie let me conclude on page 13.
Despite that, we have not a very strong macro environment at the moment, we see support from the change to -- the shift to e-commerce, our exposure to the emerging markets and I think our service quality capabilities, and therefore, we expect going forward good growth rates for our business.
Of course, e-commerce is the most important one and we have across the board a unique set of skills for all e-commerce aspects.
Going forward, we should see a margin increase in all divisions, but even more so in EBIT, absolute EBIT improvement as we have promised.
Free cash flow remains a key focus for us.
We have done pretty well over the last years and we will continue to do so, because that is definitely something where we have spent more time in the last quarters.
And I think I am very happy with the development we see also in the third quarter with regard to cash flow development.
Overall, we are well on our way to deliver strategy 2020 and I think we will take further steps in the last quarter and then beyond 2016 the coming year.
So I am very happy with the performance year to date.
It was another record quarter, the fourth now in a row and I'm very confident that we will make our numbers for the remainder of the year.
And with that, I hand over now to Melanie to give you a little bit more details on the actual numbers.
Thank you for listening.
Yes, thank you, Frank.
And good afternoon, good morning also from my side to all of you who have joined us on the call today.
I'm very pleased to review our Q3 financial results in a bit more detail today.
As Frank already said, it was overall a very solid quarter with a Group EBIT of EUR755 million.
It was the strongest third quarter ever in the current Group structure.
And what is very positive is that we really had a solid contribution from all divisions.
All divisions have moved forward compared to last year.
I think the second very positive element is that the positive EBIT development has also translated into solid progress on the net profit and free cash flow side.
So let's start with a look at our Group P&L for the third quarter, which you can see on page 15.
Starting with a couple of comments on the revenue line, I think after the last quarter that's not really surprising we still see negative currency effects.
We still see the impact of lower fuel prices.
And we have the special case of the big supply chain customer NHS, which leads to the decline in revenue year over year.
When you adjust for those three facts, the Group revenue is actually up 2.4%.
And this is predominantly driven by solid growth in Express, which is up 5.3% organically and PeP with 4.3% organic growth.
Taking a look at the EBIT, you see a very substantial increase from the roughly EUR200 million we had in the third quarter of 2015 to now EUR755 million.
But you are all aware of the significant one-off effect we had in the third quarter of 2015, most notably the write-down effect on NFE.
The overall impact in global forwarding freight of one-off was EUR384 million in the last year.
But even when you strip out all the one-off's from the third quarter of 2015 we see very, very solid year-over-year improvement.
And that is driven both from PeP and from DHL, and I'll talk about the specific P&L for the divisions in a bit more detail in a second.
The next thing I want to point out on page 15 is our tax rate.
We had a number of effects.
We were able to activate more tax loss carry forward.
And that has now led to an improved tax rate for the full year.
The full year forecast is now at 11%.
And we have reflected that in our tax line for the third quarter.
So putting all that together, as you can see, the consolidated net profit for the quarter stands at EUR618 million.
When we take a look at the overall dynamic in the different divisions, you can see an overview on page 16.
Starting with PeP on the left side, some of you may still recall the time when we had year over year decline in the EBIT of the PeP division.
At that time, we gave out a guidance that we want to stabilize the PeP EBIT at around EUR1 billion.
Since 2013, thanks to the parcel boom and thanks to e-commerce, we have been able to really go back into growth mode also in the PeP division.
The special events, the strike in 2015, have been a temporary setback, but you can now really see that we are back on a growth trajectory in the PeP division.
And then we take a look at the DHL division.
You can see that in all three DHL divisions we are clearly building momentum towards our 2020 target.
On the Express side, the margin was above 10% already one year earlier than we had originally guided.
And now also in the third quarter we have seen a 1.3 percentage point margin expansion compared to the third quarter of last year.
And looking at our more asset-light divisions, global forwarding freight and supply chain, on the global forwarding line you can clearly see the impact of the year of transition 2015.
We are now again moving in the right direction.
Our first goal is now to get back to the profitability levels we saw before NFE, so getting back to a level of around 3%.
But then clearly with the new IT transformation delivering benefits over time, our aspiration is to really get to industry-leading margin.
And on the supply chain side, you can also see that we are moving in the right direction.
For the third quarter, we have actually achieved a 4% margin in supply chain.
So that is kind of like the lower end of the range we have also set for 2020 where we are targeting something like 4% to 5%.
That takes me to page 17 where you can see our cash flow statement for the quarter.
Many of those negative one-off effects we had in the third quarter of 2015 were actually non-cash.
So it was to be expected that we wouldn't see a one-to-one translation of the EBIT increase into cash flow.
But you can see that on operating cash flow before changes in working capital we actually had a very, very positive improvement by EUR200 million compared to the third quarter of 2015.
Taking a look at the working capital line, we had a positive contribution from working capital.
But it's a bit lower than last year, which is primarily due to the extremely strong performance in the third quarter of last year, particularly from global forwarding freight.
On the CapEx side, we had some phasing effects in investment projects, which led to a comparatively low net CapEx for the third quarter.
But overall, we still expect CapEx to be around our guidance, the EUR2.2 billion we had shared with you at the beginning of the year.
The reason is that, as we have already discussed for example in our capital markets tutorial in London a couple of weeks ago, we still have the peak of the investment phase in Express, which will continue into next year.
The new extension in Leipzig just opened, but we are still working on Brussels and East Midlands, so there is still a bit of investment activity going on, on the Express side.
And in PeP, the majority of the invest is actually into the parcel Germany expansion.
The international expansion is relatively CapEx light.
So when you put it all together we ended up with a free cash flow of EUR543 million for the third quarter.
And when you take a look at where we stand after nine months, leaving aside the pension funding from the spring, we are significantly ahead in terms of free cash flow, more than EUR200 million for the first nine months compared to 2015.
And, of course, you also expect, like every year, that the fourth quarter is going to be the big quarter on the free cash flow generation side.
And so we are very confident that we will also hit our target and aspirations for free cash flow for the full year 2016.
That takes me to page 18, our net debt development.
I don't want to go into all the details here.
I think most buckets are familiar to you.
The one thing I want to highlight here is that with the third quarter we have actually included the full EUR1 billion for the share buyback in our net debt calculation.
At the end of the third quarter we had executed roughly half of it, so we had spent EUR500 million.
But we have now, accounting-wise, recognized the full EUR1 billion in our net debt calculation.
Status as of last night is that we have now spent more than EUR650 million on the share buyback.
And as you can see, we are confident that we will actually also execute on the remaining portion.
For the fourth quarter, we clearly expect that the number net debt will move in the right direction driven by the strong free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter.
And that takes me to a quick look at what is happening in the divisions, starting on page 19 with the PeP division.
So, as already mentioned, we are back in growth mode in PeP.
We had a revenue growth of 4%.
And that really nicely flows through to the EBIT line.
When you look at the breakdown of our PeP EBIT, and that's also nothing really new, we still generate the EBIT predominantly in Germany and here we have seen good progress thanks to the growth in parcels.
Clearly, the stamp price increase has helped, but we've also seen a very strong discipline on the cost side.
With regard to the international parcel business outside Germany, we now have a figure of 1.
Last quarter it was minus 1.
I think that's in line with what we have said, we are in an investment mode, so it's not going to be a major contribution, but it's also not a burden for our profitability.
Looking at the strong -- looking at the operating cash flow.
We can see that the improvement on the EBIT side really also materialized in the OCF for the PeP division.
And on the CapEx side, yes, we had EUR139 million.
Maybe interesting for you to note is that out of those EUR139 million CapEx, actually EUR121 million went into parcel Germany.
So by far the biggest CapEx spend in PeP is in parcel Germany.
And the international expansion is predominantly an OpEx topic.
And that you can follow nicely in the line I've just mentioned earlier.
Taking a look at the Express figures.
As already mentioned, clearly currency and lower fuel price has had an impact on the top line.
Adjusting for those effects, revenue growth was actually 5.3%.
Last year we had a positive one-off effect in our EBIT numbers for Express.
We had the EUR82 million asset write-up in the United States.
When we take that out, we see that the Express EBIT has actually grown by 19% year over year and on the margin side, we have seen an expansion by 1.3 percentage points.
And that strong EBIT performance is also translating into a solid operating cash flow.
And with regard to CapEx, that was a very strong CapEx quarter last year.
And we still expect a bit of CapEx to come in the fourth quarter for the Express division.
Turning to page 21, global forwarding freight, Frank already mentioned the fundamental dynamics.
On the ocean freight side, we have now seen for the fourth consecutive quarter solid volume growth and a good development on the gross profit side.
In air freight, yes, it's now a bit of growth, but clearly on the profitability side that's still challenging.
And so you can see that our gross profit overall is just slightly up compared to last year, but again beginning to move into the right direction.
When you look at the EBIT line, we had the EUR384 million negative one-off in Q3 2015.
If we take those out we had an underlying EBIT of EUR47 million last year and so there was also a healthy growth by 34% from EUR47 million to EUR63 million in the current quarter.
Cash flow is a little bit below last year.
That is really due to the very strong working capital performance we had seen in the third quarter of 2015.
And CapEx, forwarding freight is our, by far, least CapEx intensive division.
You can see that very clearly in the numbers for the third quarter.
Coming to the fourth division, supply chain, on the EBIT side, we have really made good progress, but we have to bear in mind that last year we had the sizeable restructuring one-off.
But even when we take out the restructuring effects, we have seen really now good progress on the supply chain EBIT.
And, as I've already mentioned in terms of margin, we are now for the third quarter at 4%.
And cash flow is a bit down year over year.
That is also primarily due to unfavorable working capital movement, which of course we hope to catch up with again in the fourth quarter.
Yes that was an overview of what is happening in the different divisions and I'm already at the last slide of my presentation, page 23.
There is not a lot of news on this page.
The one number we have changed is we have adjusted our tax rate to 11% and no other changes neither to our 2016 guidance nor to our 2020 target.
I want to say in conclusion that with the third quarter results I just talked you through in a bit more detail, we are well on track to deliver our full year numbers for 2016.
And that will of course, then also be a very important next step towards executing our 2020 targets.
Thank you very much for your attention and I think we are now ready to take your questions.
(Operator Instructions).
The first question comes from Mr.
Neil Glynn from Credit Suisse.
Please go ahead, sir.
Good afternoon, everybody.
If I could ask two quick questions, the first one with respect to the discount rate reductions for business customers within PeP.
I'm just interested in terms of how you justify that to customers in terms of your pitch.
Is it due to ongoing inflationary pressure around the mail network, or is it due to increased cost of service given declining volumes?
And then a second question with a similar theme.
Obviously the DGFF division has had now almost a year of a far more stable performance.
And I guess that should resonate with customers.
So as you renegotiate contracts with customers, has that helped you commercially in your negotiations?
Yes, so Neil, I think the first one you answered pretty well already, because it's true, of course we have inflation and we are communicating that.
It's less driven by less scale,  I think that's more for the records than price increase, but you're right, there is inflation and therefore, we have to deal with that.
On DGF, overall, we get more positive response, but this market is still very competitive anyway.
There is a mixture of service is a must have and keeps you in the business.
I think we are not in the level that we really can expect a premium.
That should be the goal to do that.
But all our customers are significantly under cost pressure themselves, because there is not too much economic growth.
Therefore, I would say that this will be a competitive -- fierce competitive situation we continue.
And you see where some companies who are doing well in that industry where are probably more advanced with harmonizing their processes and are better equipped with IT, and that's our strategy going forward too.
Understood and just to follow on, just your avoidance of GP per TEU pressure due to Hanjin, would you attribute that to your phase of development within DGF, or are there other factors that helped you there?
I think in ocean freight you can see already that we are probably more on a basis that we have not only large customers, but also small and mid-sized customers and that helped, I think, to protect our margin pretty well.
That helps as well to grow and therefore, we are more advanced, I think, on the ocean freight front than on the air freight.
I feel encouraged by that, despite the headwinds in air freight, because in principle the countries can deliver good growth and profitable growth.
If we can do that in ocean freight, we should be able, over time, as well in the air freight to demonstrate that.
So we had relatively little impact from Hanjin's insolvency.
I think it's more your overall customer portfolio, which is better in ocean freight already than in air freight.
Great.
Thanks Frank.
You're welcome.
Thanks, Neil.
The next caller please.
The next question comes from Mr.
Christopher Combe from JP Morgan.
Please go ahead.
Hi.
Good afternoon, everyone.
I just have two questions.
First on PeP.
You've just reiterated your 2020 targets in terms of Group EBIT growth and for PeP.
What contribution should we expect from international, given that it's currently running at breakeven and looking out a couple of years?
And then second, with Express, you called out that B2C is now somewhere above 20% of TDI.
How much higher would you expect this mix to go, or could it go, if that's possible to predict?
And is there any reason you would expect the margin contribution to vary significantly?
It sounds like at present it's comparable to the B2B contribution.
Thanks.
So Melanie takes the first, I take the second question.
So I think it's very difficult to predict.
As long as we see what we have seen in the last years, that we can grow profitable in B2C world, we will continue to serve these customers and I think that's the right answer to that.
We have no goal what -- how much it should be.
I think we have to improve our service quality constantly, we have to optimize the costs, and we are doing that.
Sorry, you said despite the increase in B2C volume we have not seen an increase in cost per move on the first and last mile.
That should help.
So I'm -- we are looking again into where we can improve our margin in the next years and at the same time, grow the top line and that should lead then that we really can grow the bottom line significantly over the next years.
And maybe just to add a bit of flavor as well.
I was the Express CFO at the time when we were still at the 10% share of B2C shipments and we had intense debates at this point in time how should we position ourselves with regard to B2C.
Clearly, the majority of the B2C market is not attractive for Express, but there is a slice of the market where customers are willing to pay the prices we need in our Express network.
And what I find very encouraging in the slide Frank showed earlier and which we also used in London for the e-comm tutorial, is during the time when the share of B2C increased from 10% to 20%, we have actually been able to significantly improve our margin and profitability in Express because we have a very strict management on what kind of B2C business we want to have in the network.
So, I think the Express team is relatively relaxed with regard to growth.
When you take the numbers apart, you will also see that there is still very healthy growth on the non-B2C side.
Reverse engineering the numbers we have shown you, showed that there is still, on the B2B side, also very healthy growth.
And I think that is historically one of the strengths of the Express business, that across the sectors and they see B2C as a vertical, we have great growth opportunities.
Coming to your question on PeP international, what can we expect, like we said a couple of weeks ago, we don't expect a significant contribution now over the next quarters.
We have been now around the breakeven line and that is not going to change materially.
But towards 2020 we expect to then see an increase in contribution out from the PeP international line.
And we are going to show that very transparently so that you can really follow the progress we have in that area quarter over quarter.
It's a little bit difficult to predict that.
So we don't need significant contribution from this area for our goals we have in our minds.
But, the more successful we are to grow these businesses and turn them profitable the more we will invest in these areas to accelerate the growth.
And that makes it a little bit tricky how much contribution you really can expect.
It might be very little, but that doesn't mean that we have been far too successful in many countries already and therefore, we have expanded our network further.
And of course, we can't walk on water and we will generate losses at the first place.
So it's a little bit tricky question with regard to that.
At the moment, I feel personally very encouraged what I have seen -- what we are doing there and there is a demand for a quality product in B2C, even in low price markets.
And that encouraged me that we have formed the right recipe for success.
The further we grow and faster we grow, the lesser we will have an impact probably in our P&L and to the reason I've just mentioned.
Thanks.
That's very clear.
The next question comes from Mr.
Tobias Sittig from MainFirst.
Please go ahead.
Yes, good afternoon.
Thanks for taking my questions.
Three for me please.
On Express, can you help me understand the margin development a little better?
So basically, when I look back in history, usually at 100 basis point lower margins in Q3 versus Q2 this time round it seems like 200 basis points and also the prices in Europe seem to have come under pressure.
So is there really just a seasonal effect there, or what is driving that?
And what makes you confident that margins will go back up again in the pattern that we've seen earlier this year?
And then secondly, on the mail side, 5% volume growth.
You display some confidence that will go to 2% to 3%, but could you share what makes you so positive?
Because from the latest trends we're seeing, I don't really get to the 2% to 3% mid-term and also other markets seem to have rather higher declines, such as Austria lately.
And lastly, in your cash flow statement, there's again a relatively sizeable move in provisions of EUR351 million.
Can you please explain what has been driving that?
Thank you very much.
So Melanie, may you take the first and the third.
So, first of all, we see year-to-date only a decline of 3.5%.
The second is this is more anecdotal evidence from what we hear from our customers and of course, we have a quite sizeable sales force and we get a lot of information what they plan to do going forward and whatsoever.
So that is not 100% guarantee, but the evidence we hear from our sales force is telling us that that would be not a major drop in volumes beyond the 2% to 3%.
As I said, to be honest, I can't guarantee that, but this is the best evidence I can take.
We haven't lost any major customers, nor anybody is telling us we will shift away completely from physical mailings to online or whatsoever.
So that makes us confident that the decline will only be in the 2% to 3% area.
Yes, then let me take your first and third questions.
So first of all on Express, for me the more important number I look at is really the year over year development where, if you take out the asset write-up from the third quarter of 2014, we have really again expended the margin by more than 1%.  1.3 percentage points to be precise.
So I think that is still in line with the strong trend we have seen over the past quarters.
And yes, as you saw in one of the slides Frank presented, there has been some changes now in where the growth is coming from.
But I think that shows really the resilience of our global Express network, that overall from the different regions we are able to generate very healthy shipment growth.
And one number I always look at very closely is the base revenue per kilo development, where we have seen a positive development already for the first two quarters and that has actually improved in the third quarter.
So I'm very confident that the Express [total] is unchanged and that we will see a very solid fourth quarter on the Express side.
And then coming to the provision question in our cash flow statement, so first of all, I think that's due to some one-off effects we had last year, like the (inaudible).
But there's also a reclassification from -- you know we do this early retirement program for civil servants, which is now being reclassified from provisions into the payout phase, and that is a significant driver in the provision line.
How much does that account for?
How much does that account for?
I can't tell you the exact number, but it is a sizeable thing.
We can follow-up on this later.
But that is really from my recollection the main driver in this year's numbers.
It should be something around EUR140 million-ish, but [Liard] can give you the exact figure.
But it's definitely a double-digit number.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Okay, thank you, Tobias and we take the next caller please.
The next question comes from Mr.
Andy Chu from Deutsche Bank.
Please go ahead.
Thanks very much.
Good afternoon, Frank, Melanie and Martin.
Two questions from me please.
Firstly on Express.
I wondered if you might be able to breakout the differential in growth rates between B2C and B2B.
At your tutorial I think you mentioned that B2C was obviously growing fast, but would you be able to give us a magnitude of difference in growth rates?
And following on from that, the 5% to 6% growth rate in the markets, again could you segment that between B2C and B2B?
And then my second question is around looking into Q4, and things that I can identify looking into Q4 include things like wage increases from October 1, a catch-up in terms of restructuring charges and stamp price provision.
So I wondered if there is anything that I was missing off that list when looking into Q4.
And maybe is it possible to give a bit of quantification over the level of stamp price provision reversal in Q4, which I think was at a quite high level of EUR71 million in Q4 last year.
Thank you very much.
So Melanie, you can explain B2B and B2C.
So I'm not sure if we really even have made that math, what the market growth should be.
So what you definitely can take away is that the B2B growth is significantly slower than B2C growth and when we suggested that growth rate, it was a combination of everything and so far I think we have been pretty right with that.
So we expected that the Express market overall would grow slightly more than the GDP growth on a gross number and not a net number.
And yes, of course, B2C will grow faster than B2B, that's for sure.
So Melanie, you might answer the other two other questions.
Yes, so when you look at the numbers, we have shown how the B2C share has grown from 2013 to 2016, you can calculate that the B2B growth correspondingly has been around 4%.
And I think that's also a good expectation going forward, that it will stay in the 4% to maybe 5% order of magnitude.
With regard to the fourth quarter in PeP, you're absolutely correct, we have the rate increase now coming in, this 2%, as of October 1.
In terms of stamp provisions, movements, this is now automatically calculated from the consumption and sale of them and I don't have a forecast for that.
Last year it was a bit of a special situation because we had the new methodology, plus we had the increase to EUR0.70, so people had to stock up with new stamps.
Well first use up the old ones and then at the beginning of the year stock up with the new ones.
This year, because we don't have a change in the underlying stamp price, there should be less volatility, but we don't have an exact forecast for that.
Andy?
Could I just ask one follow-up question on TDI volume growth, which is still at a very healthy 6.8% in volume terms?
But just looking over the last couple of years, I think, if I'm not wrong, that's your slowest volume growth since Q4 2014.
So is there anything in the mix, or anything that points to a trend that growth is actually going to be more towards the current levels versus a range of 8% to 9% that you've been very, very sticky around over the last 12 months?
Thank you.
Yes, well I would say that going forward it will be probably more around the 7%.
You can see that in this quarter there was a lower growth number from Asia and that the trend here is now seen for some quarters.
It's nothing we are overly concerned about, because you can see how the other regions are nicely catching it up, giving us the overall growth of 6.8%.
But I think to forecast 8% to 9% at this point in time, given also the general macro situation, would be overly optimistic.
So I'm more thinking in the 7 percentage range.
Thanks very much.
Thanks, Andy and the next caller please.
The next question comes from Mr.
Damian Brewer from the Royal Bank of Canada.
Please go ahead.
Good afternoon, everybody, I've got a couple of questions that haven't been answered yet.
First of all, going back to PeP on the international business, I appreciate the revenue there has grown considerably on a nine-month basis from EUR1.4 billion to EUR1.6 billion.
Just give us some idea of, if you like, the proof of concept on that business and the OpEx you're putting into the expansion.
If you were to look at just the EUR1.4 billion base from the first nine months of last year, could you give us a feel for what the profitability of that business would have done, including the growth that occurred in it, stripping out the additional territories you've gone into since then?
And then the second question, on the tax rate reduced to 11%.
Could you give us a feel for how much of that will have a carry forward effect into 2017, i.e. have all the deferred tax assets you've activated been utilized in that 11% projection, or is there some carry forward effect there?
And if there is, I appreciate it's early, but how do you think the Board or Boards will think about that in terms of setting the dividend for the full year basis?
On the first subject, maybe Melanie you answer it.
First, I understand the reason for your question, but I'm a little bit reluctant to disclose what the profitability without any new investments have been because this is something which we want to keep at the moment.
We are -- as we said, we don't expect a significant profitability contribution, but we don't want to tell at the moment the bits and pieces exactly and that also for competitive reasons.
So please understand that we are not disclosing that at the current stage.
But what I can tell you is that we, of course, invested also in the existing businesses to change that into B2C.
Some of them have been very much linked to B2B and we have investments in the legacy taken over from Express businesses as well.
So even if you ignore that, it's not like that this profitability is not growing like hell and the rest is just investment.
We are investing in all parts to convert them from a more focused B2B into a B2B and B2C world and that takes operational costs there too.
Again let me continue with the tax rate.
So yes, we have been able to activate more deferred tax assets, but there is still a substantial amount of unutilized tax loss carry forward.
And as we increase profitability and our forward projections in those countries where we still have significant tax loss carry forward, for example, in the United States, this is also giving us upside potential going forward.
I'm not going to give you a tax guidance for the next year.
We're just finalizing our budget for 2017 and we will then give you a number with our guidance in March.
So, clearly, 11% is quite a low number and it will probably not stay quite that low, but as every year we will look for opportunities to manage our tax rate very carefully.
And with regard to dividend, yes, I can understand where you're coming from and there's some obvious maths you can do on the basis of our numbers.
But that's, of course, also a topic where we will only take a decision once the books for the year are closed.
And so I think at the moment the whole focus of the organization is on really first delivering our fourth quarter numbers and the full year guidance for 2016.
Okay, thank you.
Can I ask just one cheeky follow-on, if possible, just on the international PeP?
Given the expectation of better returns later, what causes in your budget the tipping point of the business from being marginally profitable to becoming a more profitable contributor?
Is it simply volume down the same network, or is there something else in there?
No, I think it is really scale and scale doesn't have to be always significant market share, because some of the markets are growing very rapidly and therefore, we can reach enough scale and that should be then the turning point.
But if you have a network, you have not full utilization neither from your warehouses nor your couriers and therefore, it takes some time.
And if you are successful, because we are not providing in some start-up countries straight away full coverage of all zip codes, so we are doing that in some areas and if we see that it helps, then we extend the number of zip codes and therefore, that takes some time until you get sufficiently scale all over the place.
But the reason behind profitability is really scale and in the emerging countries that should be doable just by growing significantly with the market, because these markets are very immature yet.
What the test we do at the moment is that is there demand in these markets for a high quality product that we provide, and we see very positive response of the market and the customers for that.
That makes me confident that we can really grow significantly in many of these markets.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Thanks Damian.
Next caller please.
The next question comes from Mr.
David Ross at Stifel.
Please go ahead, sir.
Yes, good afternoon, everyone.
A couple of questions from my end.
One, it was very evident from the Capital Markets Day in London and then also on the last number of our conference calls that DHL is very excited about e-commerce and positioning the business to benefit from the trends in e-commerce.
But what would you say is the part of your business that is most negatively impacted by the e-commerce trend because e-commerce is not good for all modes of transportation and for all supply chains?
And then second question, Frank, is really about your view of the organizational structure at DHL, or Deutsche Post DHL.
About 450,000 employees across the world today.
As you grow up to your 2020 targets, where do you see that number going?
And do you think you have to change anything, just from an organizational structure standpoint, to get the best benefit out of the large organization?
So the -- maybe let me start with the org structure and I can't see any reason why we need to change that.
I think we have really developed a pretty admirable organization to cope with that.
By focusing on the respective elements, like the transfer of these Express domestic businesses to PeP has been proven to be successful, I don't see any need to change massive structures anyway, because our models are really focusing on their respective modes and the focus and that has given us traction.
To be honest, I can't see at the moment -- if I answer your first question -- I can't at the moment really see massive negative impact of any.
Even in the air freight business we see an increasing amount of e-customer e-tailers who are demanding for air freight shipments.
In supply chain, there will be more warehousing activities.
It might be that the landscape of competitors is changing, because there are some newcomers entering the market, but overall I think we have -- we will benefit in all areas and we see that already, if I look into what kind of requests we get on road freight transportation, air freight, on supply chain.
So I can't really see at the moment any of the divisions will suffer from the ecommerce move.
Okay.
That's answered?
Good.
The next caller then.
The next question comes from Mr.
Dominic Edridge from UBS.
Please go ahead.
Yes, thanks very much and good afternoon from me, just two questions.
Firstly, it's a slightly technical question looking at the tax side of things, just in terms of what that means on the cash tax perspective.
From what I understand, it doesn't particularly have a lot of flow through on the cash tax payments.
Can you just confirm that if that's okay?
And secondly, can I just confirm that the lower tax rate came out of the EUR10 billion of unrecognized tax loss carry forwards that you, I think, disclosed at the last annual report?
And has that moved very much during the course of the year?
Because occasionally we do seem to find that the tax losses do seem to go up due to tax rulings, etc.
And just on that also, can you just then breakdown how much of the tax losses are actually German tax losses as opposed to non-German tax losses?
And then the second question, a very different one, is just on the 2020 targets.
Obviously, since you gave those targets there's been a little bit of a rocky ride.
Obviously this year you've seen quite a lot of recovery.
Can you just say -- it sounds as though from what you were saying about some of the business developments in terms of freight forwarding, the non-German parcel business, et cetera, that some of the paybacks are going to be a little bit more towards the tail end of the forecast period.
Is that the right way of thinking about it in terms of how profits should develop from 2017 to 2020?
Thanks very much.
Yes, so I think the last year was overall more the exception than the rule.
We announced that already early on that 2015 will be a year of transformation because we expected, if you really want to get to a different cost level for the employees for the parcel delivery, we have to go through a quite interesting period with the unions.
And we were quite successful in achieving that.
On the DGF front, that's a major hit because the way we went to with SAP didn't work out and therefore we changed course.
We will see now a more step-by-step approach and more an evolution in development.
And therefore, you're right, the first target is to get to the same levels of margin like we had before, and then the next step is to improve it further until 2020.
So there will be probably more -- there will be a continuous benefit from the improvement in DGF, but the steps going forward will be smaller and then we will see if we get the benefits from the renewal of two bigger steps again.
But it's different -- the approach is no different from the past, where we said we will have a deep dip in the profitability and then it will go up again.
We will see now that progression in profitability, but not at the same pace as in the last 12 months due to the fact that we are now continuing in investing at the same time in our operations to improve it later on further.
But we will not see a dip either, so therefore, it's true that this will contribute significantly more to the later end and the same is true, of course, for our investments in Parcel Europe and in e-commerce, as we already said.
The others should more develop on a more even development path.
Okay, coming to your tax questions, you're of course absolutely right, there's not a one-to-one connection between the tax rate and the cash taxes paid.
On the cash taxes paid side, we expect a slightly higher number, more around 16% to 17% for this year.
So yes, I think that is the order of magnitude.
When you look at what we've paid in taxes last year in cash, we will probably be in the same order of magnitude also for the current year.
With regards to tax loss carried forward, you're right, at the end of last year we talked about EUR10 billion of not recognized tax loss carry forward.
The biggest chunk of that is from the United States, more than half of it and that was also one area where we were able to now activate more deferred tax assets.
The second biggest country is Germany, also here in terms of non-recognized tax loss carried forward, Germany is the second largest country.
In terms of overall tax loss carried forward, it's the largest country and here as well we have been able to activate more.
But there are also a number of other countries where we still have substantial not recognized tax loss carried forward and that's, of course, an area we're actively working on to improve that going forward.
Okay, thank you very much.
Thanks, Dominic and we are ready for the next caller then.
The next question comes from Miss.
Penny Butcher from Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.
Hi there.
Good afternoon, everyone.
Two questions from my side.
The first is to come back on the forwarding point, just a bit more on the outlook.
If I'm understanding correctly, the new divisional CEO will begin in the New Year.
How do you view his priorities in terms of whether it be a gross profit and volume driven recovery, or some more OpEx optimization as the key goals in terms of what it is that he will be directed to do within the division?
And my second question is perhaps for Melanie.
I think you brought up at the CMD event in October that while you wouldn't be changing many of the financial goals, or how the Company's outlook is presented, you did say that you wanted to focus more on free cash flow.
And I got the impression that was more on conversions of free cash flow from the operating earnings.
Is it fair to say that it might be possible that you could start setting some targets in terms of free cash flow conversion, or maybe some divisional goals in that sense going forward?
Thanks.
Yes, so on the first one, since Tim Scharwath is still on the payroll of one of our competitors, I haven't had a chance to talk with him about his strategy and his priorities yet.
But what I can say from where he comes from, I can guess that first of all, he definitely will help us to regain a growth in the air freight area, particularly with smaller and mid-sized customers, seeing as that was his home turf as the Head of Marketing and Sales in air freight and we have a challenge there.
My clear hope is that we learn some tricks how to do that better.
The second is if I follow Kuehne + Nagel from the outside, they are very clear on conversion rate and our conversion rate is far behind our own conversion rate we had already achieved, and far behind what some of our competitors are doing.
And I think he will focus on that and that is, of course, optimizing your costs, because that's below the gross profit.
And I hope that he has good answers where we can do better.
And he definitely has a significantly deeper understanding of that business than I and probably can find easily some areas where we can reduce costs further.
And the third is having started himself IT, he definitely will help us on the IT renewal roadmap.
So these would be, from my perspective, if I have the discussion in the future with him, I would see that these are the futures.
And my perception on him as a person is that he's very well equipped to do that.
So that's where and I'm very optimistic that he will help us to work on these priorities, even if I have not discussed that with him yet, due to the fact that he's still on the payroll of our competitor.
Yes, well maybe a couple of sentences on free cash flow overall and our aspirations here.
You know that last year we had an extremely strong fourth quarter with regard to free cash flow, and that helped us to achieve a good number for the full year.
Then also that among other things to the decision to go for the share buyback.
Of course, we saw in the first quarter a bit of a kickback.
But what I find really very pleasing is that through a strong focus across the organization, now after the nine months we're actually EUR200 million better than what we were last year.
So we have really overcompensated the big effort from the fourth quarter of 2015.
We have, in our guidance page, the statement that we want to at least earn our dividend for the year.
But so, for example, we expect to close the UK Mail transaction before the year is over and clearly, we expect that then after that transaction levels will be enough free cash flow to pay the dividend.
So I think that gives you a feeling for our expectations towards the fourth quarter and I'm quite confident that we will make that.
We have intense discussions with our divisions now as part of the budgeting process, not only about their EBIT targets, but also about their cash flow targets.
We are incentivizing all our top 2,100 executives on cash flow, so that is really something within the Company which is very high on everybody's priority list, because also peoples' bonus depends on it.
But I'm not at a point yet where I would want to share external conversion goals by division.
Okay, thank you.
You're welcome.
Thanks, Penny and the next caller please.
The next question comes from Mr.
Mark McVicar from Barclays.
Please go ahead.
Good afternoon, everybody.
Hi, two fairly quick questions.
I totally get the gross CapEx guidance is still EUR2.2 billion, but your net CapEx after nine months is only EUR1.3 billion.
Can you give us an idea of where you think the net CapEx will end up for the year?
Yes, you are absolutely right that there is still a bit of a way to go in the fourth quarter.
But that is a trend we are somewhat seeing every year.
We discuss that intensely.
I would really prefer it to be spread out a bit more evenly over the year, but at this point in time we expect that on the gross CapEx side we will move towards EUR2.2 billion.
In terms of cash out from CapEx, it will clearly be EUR200 million to EUR300 million lower than that.
That also really depends a little bit on our payables management in the fourth quarter closing.
Okay, that's great.
Thank you.
The second question is that obviously within Parcel Europe and e-commerce, so all of the 2C stuff outside of Germany, we're seeing the reported -- the blended average of the results in a number of countries, some of which will be making money, some of which won't be because of where they are.
Just as a medium-term guidance, if you look across all the countries in that group, without naming it, what's the country with the highest margin?
Sorry, what is the highest margin in any single country?
Hi Mark, I'm afraid we will not disclose that either.
And I think it -- and it doesn't make too much sense because the dynamics of the markets are very different and therefore, it's very difficult to judge.
In particular we are also in some of these markets, we started more or less as a complete B2B and are transforming that and we have not really a final understanding what the target margin in these countries will be.
And therefore, I would be a little bit reluctant in saying something now which I have to correct later on.
Okay.
It was worth a try anyway.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Okay, well thank you, Mark and we are almost 45 minutes into the Q&A now.
Let's see whether there are any further callers out there, operator.
(Operator Instructions).
Mr.
Ziegenbalg, there seem to be no further questions at this time.
Please continue with any other points you wish to raise.
Well then it's time for us to conclude the call.
Before I hand over to some concluding remarks by Frank, I'd like to thank you for your attention.
Looking forward to seeing you either sale side, buy side over the next couple of weeks and with that, over to you, Frank, please.
Yes, so thank you for joining us this afternoon.
I'm very pleased with the progress we have seen.
We are well on our way to deliver what we have promised for this year.
We have good traction in all divisions and that makes me very confident that we have laid the right foundation this year for further growth in the next years to come and therefore, we are very confident as a senior team that we are on the right journey to deliver our 2020 target.
So there is still a long way to go and a lot of work to be done, but I think we have the right measures in our mind and we know what to do going forward.
So thank you very much again for joining us and talk to you soon.
Thank you.
