Full Year 2016 Tesco PLC Earnings Call (Fixed Income Investor)
Welcome to the Tesco 2016 conference results call.
(Operator Instructions)
Just as a reminder, this  conference call is being recorded.
Today, I'm pleased to present Alan Stuart.
Please begin your meeting.
Great.
Thank you very much, everybody, and good afternoon.
I'm joined here today by with Shubhi Rao, who is the Group Treasurer, and I want to thank you for your time.
We, as you know,  announced results yesterday  and they had a lot of coverage.
You may  want to  walk -- watch the webcast.
The purpose of today's call is specifically focused on fixed income and before we kick off though, I'd just really like to run through the key messages from yesterday, just to remind you of what they were.
We have begun the process of transformation and what we have seen is a positive volume growth which has been the key metric that we've been looking for and we've seen that.
The results of that volume growth is a recovery in profitability and particularly,  if you look in the UK business from the second half of the 2014/2015 year through to the second half of the year we've just reported on, we've seen a significant increase in profitability.
Overall, Group profits were GBP944 million compared with GBP940 million the previous year.
In respect to our three priorities, we've made good progress and significant progress.
We are more competitive in the UK.
The profits show that, but much more importantly, the customer measures, which are  the way the customers tell us they see us are significantly improved in the -- in all metrics whether it is availability, whether it is service, whether it's range, or whether it's price and perception.
And then I think from a balance sheet perspective, very clearly, we've in reducing  our total indebtedness by GBP6.2 billion, we've made significant progress in reducing the indebtedness and thereby strengthening and protecting the balance sheet.
And we've also appraised the pension scheme, totally introduced the DC scheme and a good improvement with the underlying pension deficit decreasing by GBP1.3 billion as well year on year.
And then the third priority, the rebuilding trust in Tesco.
This is one which, again,  important from  all constituents, whether it's customers, whether it's suppliers, whether it's colleagues, or indeed, whether it's the investor market.
The feeling we get is that we've made good progress there but that's something which, again, we'll always be wanting to be judged by others rather than us doing the judging.
Finally, I think it's clear to understand that we have an improvement which is broad-based.
Our performance in all regions, whether we are talking about the UK or the Republic of Ireland, Europe or Asia, has improved.
We saw positive sales growth in all regions in Q4.
And volumes transactions and customer numbers are up and we see that in the sales, the profit and the cash generation.
We have a clear plan for the scheme's generating  long-term sustainable value for customers and for our stakeholders.
And we are guided by a clear purpose, serving shoppers a little better every day.
We also spoke about the nearer-team outlook.
And we were clear that because of the investments we are making in the customer offer, the uncertainty of those investments, the deflationary aspect in  the market and the competition in the market means that the trajectory, which we've set out.
And we haven't changed in terms of where we would see ourselves in the  medium and  longer-term, but the trajectory, particularly in the first half of this year, is not going to be necessarily a straight line.
That's something which, from the market perspective, the market clearly was digesting through the course of yesterday and will continue to digest.
So that's the background.
In terms of specific debt metrics we had published them.
There are our metrics but we can see that we are making improvements or  certainly, the underlying improvements of the metric itself isn't changing.
But we are and remain of the view that we would want to be and issue us under an investment growth credit.
We are clear that, that will take time.
We are clear  that, that's not a decision which is ours to make because the rating agencies make that decision but it is something which we are -- we see no reason why we shouldn't be and we would want to be  but it will take time.
Now I'll open it up to questions.

Toby Hunston, Insight Investment.
Hi there.
Thanks very much for taking my questions.
Three main questions I've got.
Firstly, obviously no operating profit forecast explicitly and I think Dave perhaps said yesterday that the range was quite wide.
I was just wondering where about in that range, the GBP1.25 billion consensus sits?
It sounds like it's quite a long way at the top of that range perhaps.
Then question number two, there seems to be a bit of a secured debt that appeared on the list of liabilities and I was just wondering when that was raised and what the nature of the properties that the responder or that debt is secured against?
And then thirdly, obviously you bought back some of the leases; it seems to be very expensive in terms of you taking on [63] times as much on balance sheet debt versus off-balance sheet debt.
So is that a sustainable option given that you're placing GBP500 million, GBP600 million of leases with GBP1.5 billion of on-balance sheet debt?
Thank you.
Great, Toby.
In respect of the range, the consensus is by -- is the middle of the range, but the bottom of it and this is yesterday's numbers, clearly the market is shifting and they're reevaluating but as we went into yesterday, the bottom was around GBP1.1 billion.
And there were some due were more than GBP1.4 billion.
But so that's the answer there.
We haven't yet assessed because a number of them will take some days, if not weeks, to publish where they are.
But we will see where we are.
In respect of the secured debt, I absolutely understand the question.
Some of the properties we brought back in the British land deal and the two that we did in February had debt which was secured specifically on those properties.
And so we haven't extended any security or anything which existed before those but neither have we unwound that security but clearly, those financings are there and they have some specific elements relating to them.
But understand the question.
As the third question, which I'm sorry, I didn't write it down and Toby and I've now forgotten what you've asked me as the third question.  (multiple speakers) The price at which we buy.
The GBP115 million rental that we saved is current rental today's value of rent.
Those rentals are subject to uplifts, whether they are fixed uplifts, or RPI uplifts, and the way that we -- there are different ways of calculating these commitments.
Clearly, the rating agencies have had a multiple of today's rent.
Equally, their accounting convention is you take to a lease break and then you discount.
And what we are evaluating is because we start with the position with a store which is, do we want to be trading from this store for a long period of time.
If the answer to that is yes and the store is a store which we don't own, then we would potentially interested in, in buying it and holding it in order to remove ourselves from that long-term rental uplift.
So what we do is look at it from an economic perspective.
If there is debt behind it, which happens to be higher than a rental calculation, whether it's a simple multiple or a very close reference, then we will continue to evaluate it from a longer-term potential uplift and flexibility of property.
So there's not, at this time that we make it, necessarily a one-for-one impact but it is certainly a factor we take into account.
Okay.
Thank you and just a follow-up on that.
Should we therefore read, I guess the properties that you did buy back were presumably, particularly profitable?
And going forward that kind of ratio of PV of lease saved versus incremental debt incurred, should we expect that to be 3 times as it was in this deal or something lower?
I think it's really --  I would like to give you simple formula which you could use but I'm afraid it's not as easy as that.
It's -- it really is a function of the specific financings relating to the property.
The --  whether it's a single property, whether it's a group of properties and in fact, each of these had different characteristics with them.
But the principles we look at is -- are the way we are --  that we've set out so I'm afraid it isn't quite as easy as we've said, as we would like it to be.
In terms of the numbers, we will continue to look, as I said yesterday, in response to a question, we don't have a target other than higher than we have today.
It is a function of the availability and we continue to recognize that by talking about it and by doing it, we are -- to a certain degree, working against ourselves in the market because landlords know that it's  something that we are -- or owners know that something which we're interested in doing.
So we have to make sure that it's -- we can get the economics to work and if there's more to talk about, then we will talk about.
In the current year, there are seven properties that we've committed to.
They are somewhat over GBP100 million of -- about GBP130 million, I think, of commitment that we've -- that we can see today.
And clearly, a lot less and there's no financings behind those, that I'm aware of.
So they are small and a lot less but if opportunities arise, then -- and we will take them.
Great.
Thank you very much, Alan.
Chris Malone, Palmerston Capital.
Good afternoon.
Thanks for taking my call. (multiple speakers) A couple of housekeeping questions.
Firstly, I think you are showing between cash and short-term investments of about GBP6.46 billion but then in yesterday's presentation, you're claiming you've got GBP4.4 billion of available cash.
Can you just reconcile the GBP2 billion.
I heard you yesterday say something about the GBP750 million in the tills, but what's the other GBP1.25 billion that you're knocking off?
Sorry, can I just -- in bank, you mean Tesco Bank, rather than --? (multiple speakers)
Separate entity.
Got it, okay.
Give us a minute.
Maybe while you're looking that up, my other housekeeping question is, what's the rent number that you've put into your EBITDAR for the year?
The operating lease number?
GBP1.2 billion, around.
I think the other reconciler is, I  think you're looking at the asset side.
There's an overdraft of about GBP850 million. (multiple speakers)
Got it.
So you've got cash against that overdraft that you report -- so you're reporting the cash on the balance sheet but the -- from your Treasury point of view you don't take that into account.
Got it.
Exactly.
Okay, that makes sense there. (multiple speakers) So from a standing point of GBP4.4 billion in cash and you generated a lot of cash this year, I think more than a lot of people thought.
I'm assuming the CapEx discipline holds and you don't leak any working capital.
You're still going to generate a lot of cash.
What's the thinking in terms of the RCF?
I believe it is up for  -- is it maturity next year, early 2017? (multiple speakers) Do you need all this --  I mean, it doesn't look like you need all these facilities and all this cash, to be honest, and being that the cash looks like a bit of drag on that balance sheet, to be long-winded.
Understand again, understand the question.
So the RCF was set-up and Shubhi may want to add, but it was set-up in November 2014 as a five plus one plus one facility.
It was extended for the first year and essentially, we make decisions as we go through but I think the working assumption would be that it is extended.
And then we've got of that GBP2.6 billion, there's GBP2.4 billion of bilaterals, which expire in October next year.
Okay, so it is the bilaterals that are probably the first thing on the agenda in terms of being able to rightsize for the current liquidity profile; would that be fair to say?
Yes.
Although I think liquidity is worth -- is -- they're undrawn.
There's some cost, obviously, to having available facilities.
But in the world of uncertainty, I think it is important that we -- and in a world where people look very strongly at the indebtedness side, the liquidity and the facilities is an important part of the equation.
And I think it is something, which certainly, from my perspective and the Board's perspective, is an important part of the overall equation.
But yes, on one level, we are running with GBP4.4 billion of available cash and GBP5 billion of facilities.
We are running a deep pool of availability.
We do have some maturities which are coming up and we will make decisions on those, again, as to whether we choose to let them mature and use cash that we have or indeed, whether we think the right thing for the business is to access the capital markets.
Okay.
And is -- I mean, the thinking, obviously, there's a big negative carry impact to having all this cash versus relatively high coupon debt.
How do you think about that?
Are you more -- are you willing to pay that cost just to preserve the liquidity and to be absolutely cast iron sure that nothing can never happen?
Is that the thinking?
We certainly look at it.
I think the -- I'm always interested in taking off liabilities at less than I'm paying for them, if people are prepared to do that, but what we tend to see with holders of particularly short-dated and getting towards the end of maturities, is that the -- unless you're involved in a traditional asset liability or  liability management exercise, then people would prefer to hold to maturity then to be paid out early.
This tends to be the pace, so there's a market  dynamic there as well.
Okay.
All right, thanks for the answers.
Appreciate it.
[Lisa McLaughlin], Fidelity.
Hi.
Thanks for taking the questions.
Two for me, please.
Firstly, just on working capital.
I know, in the last year, there were various one-offs in there and for 2016/2017, is there anything we should be thinking about the one-offs with supplier payments and so on impacting or will we be purely looking at an underlying and progress there?
And my second question was on, you have a number of property-backed bonds out there and how do they fit in with your thoughts on wanting to own more of your property outright?
Great questions.
In terms of the working capital, there are three one-offs that we highlighted or issues -- or separate things that we highlighted.
One was the cash cost of the provisions we took last year at GBP91 million.
The second was the unwind of the -- by the supplier arrangements of the GBP231 million on the reciprocals.
Those will not reappear.
They were one-off.
And then the third one, which again won't reappear was the Korean working capital.
So underlying that, that made all in all, [fastest the stock].
There was a GBP350 million increase in working capital, better working capital.
So the underlying was above that and we will continue to try to generate it.
We did make good progress, as I've said, but we are a cash-generative business.
If the business performance is heading in the right direction, then we generate positive working capital anyway.
That's the nature of retailing.
One of the attractions historically and should be, we will continue to focus on and  then there's also increasing our stock term.
So I think there is opportunity but not right now,  I don't see one-offs in relation to the current yet.
In respect of the bonds, yes, the -- yes, there's no reason why starting from a perspective that, is this -- and the question is this a property that we want to trade from for a long time that we wouldn't look to have ownership of that.
I think in respect of the particular structures you're probably referring to, Lisa, the structures that were put around the bonds and the protections that we put -- that were put around the bonds as they were issued are ones which are absolutely appropriate for the purchasers and the investors at that time.
So they tend to be very long-dated bonds.
They were financed, actually, at pretty good rates, if you look at them at the time they were issued.
But the cost of changing those arrangements is something which is potentially quite high and again, you come back to the economics of liability management, as to whether that is something which makes sense or not and to date, it is not near where we've been able to see the economics working.
Great.
Thank you.

[Caroline Roger], Allianz Global Investors.
Hello, thank you.
Good afternoon.
Caroline Roger from Allianz Global Investor.
Could you please give me guidance regarding CapEx for 2016, 2017 and also as a run rate going forward?
Thank you.
Yes, hi, Caroline.
So the CapEx in the year that just ended, we had GBP1 billion pounds of CapEx.
We've given guidance of GBP1.25 billion for the current year.
We haven't guided into years beyond that but that's what we've given for the 2016/2017 year.
That's  pretty much in line with what our depreciation is.
And what I've said before, is that we would pretty much expect, over time, that depreciation and CapEx run pretty similarly.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
And as there appears to be no further questions, I return the conference to you.
Great.
Well, thank you very much everybody for your time.
I'm very happy to, as ever, to give further insight to fixed income investors and look forward to talking after the interim results in mid-October, I guess.
Thanks very much.
Bye.
Thank you.
