Good morning and welcome to Johnson & Johnson's first-quarter 2016 earnings conference call.
(Operator Instructions)
This call is being recorded.
(Operator Instructions)
I would now turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson.
You may begin.
Good morning and welcome.
I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson and it is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the first quarter of 2016.
Joining me on the call today is Dominic Caruso, our Chief Financial Officer.
A few logistics before we get into the details.
This review is being made available via a webcast accessible through the investor relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.
I'll begin by briefly reviewing the first quarter for the Corporation and for our three business segments.
Then Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and guidance for 2015.
We will then open the call to your questions.
We expect the call to last approximately one hour.
Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is a schedule of sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models.
These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website, as is the press release.
Please note, we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary.
The presentation is also available on our website.
Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are, or may be, considered forward-looking statements.
The 10-K for the FY15 and the Company's subsequent filings identify certain factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today.
The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.
Our SEC filings, including the 10-K, are available through the Company and on our website.
During the review non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for, and should be read together with, GAAP results.
Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules accompanying the press release and on the investor relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website.
A number of the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other companies.
This slide acknowledges those relationships.
Now I would like to review our results for the first quarter of 2016.
Worldwide sales to customers were $17.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016, up 0.6% versus first-quarter 2015.
On an operational basis, sales were up 3.9% and currency had a negative impact of 3.3%.
In the US sales were up 7.2%.
In regions outside the US our operational growth was 0.6%, while the effective currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 6.6%.
On an operational basis, Asia Pacific and Africa grew 3%.
Europe declined 0.8% and the western hemisphere, excluding the US, declined by 0.6%.
Results in all regions were negatively impacted by hepatitis C competition and divestitures, the most significant one being Cordis.
In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted operational growth in the western hemisphere, excluding the US.
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and hepatitis C, underlying operational growth was 6.9% worldwide, 9.8% in the US and 3.8% outside the US.
In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted worldwide and outside the US operational growth by 60 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively.
Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $4.3 billion and earnings per share were $1.54 versus $1.53 a year ago.
As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2016 first-quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude after-tax amortization expense of $205 million and a charge of $192 million for after-tax special items. 2015 first-quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a net charge of $98 million.
Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks.
Excluding amortization expense and special items for both periods, adjusted net earnings for the current quarter were $4.7 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.68, representing increases of 6.1% and 7.7%, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2015.
Currency translation significantly impacted net earnings.
On an operational basis, adjusted net earnings per share grew 10.3%.
Turning now to business segment highlights, please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in comparison to the first quarter of 2015 unless otherwise stated, and therefore exclude the currency translation impact.
I'll begin with the consumer segment.
Worldwide consumer segment sales of $3.2 billion decreased 0.2%, with US sales down 0.1% while outside the US sales were down 0.3%.
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 1.9% worldwide, 4.1% in the US and 0.5% outside the US.
In addition, the devaluation in Venezuela impacted growth worldwide and outside the US by 200 basis points and 320 basis points, respectively, with the most significant impact to women's health, oral care, and baby care.
Growth for the segment was driven primarily by OTC worldwide and oral care.
OTC sales growth was strong despite a weak flu season.
US OTC sales growth was driven by analgesic share growth and an inventory build, as well as seasonal and new product launch inventory for upper respiratory products.
In the US adult analgesic market share was approximately 14%, up from approximately 12% a year ago.
While US pediatric share was nearly 46%, up from nearly 43% a year ago.
Major contributors to the growth outside the US were the strong performance of analgesics and anti-smoking aids, partially offset by lower sales of upper respiratory products due to the fourth-quarter distributor inventory build, as noted last quarter.
New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for Listerine and oral care.
Moving now to our pharmaceutical segment.
Worldwide sales of $8.2 billion increased 8.5%, with US sales up 12.9% and sales outside the US up 2.6%, driven by both strong sales of new products as well as core growth products.
Competitors in hepatitis C significantly impacted sales this quarter.
Excluding sales of our hepatitis C products, Olysio and Incivo, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying sales growth worldwide, US and outside the US, was 12.3%, 16.2% and 7.1%, respectively.
As discussed last year, US results in the first quarter of 2015 included a positive adjustment for gross to net, including managed Medicaid rebates.
In the first quarter this year, US results included an adjustment for a similar amount and therefore overall growth was not impacted.
However on a product basis, Stelara growth in 2016 was positively impacted by approximately 16 points, Xarelto by 4 points and Remicade by 3 points.
Significant contributors to growth were immunology products Remicade, Stelara, and Simponi, Simponi Aria, oncology products Imbruvica and recently launched Darzalex, as well as cardiovascular metabolic products, Xarelto and Invokana.
The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth as well as the gross-to-net adjustment to sales that I mentioned.
Combined Remicade export sales and international sales grew approximately 11%.
Sales to distribution partners were up approximately 5%.
Sales to our international direct markets were up approximately 17%, due primarily to strong double-digit growth in the western hemisphere, excluding the US, primarily driven by timing of shipments and market growth.
Strong patient uptake with new indications, approvals and demonstrated efficacy drove the results for Imbruvica, both in the US and outside the US.
In the US Imbruvica remains the new patient share and total share leader in second-line CLL and MCL.
Imbruvica is now launched in more than 65 countries.
Darzalex was approved in the US in November 2015 and has achieved rapid uptake.
Darzalex contributed over 2% to the US pharmaceutical growth rate.
Xarelto sales were up 29% and total prescription share, or TRx, for the quarter in the US anticoagulant market grew to over 16.5%, up over 1.5 points from year ago.
TRx in primary care was nearly 14% and in cardiology nearly 23.5%, up on a sequential basis by 0.5 points and 0.3 points, respectively.
Xarelto is broadly reimbursed, with 95% of commercial and Medicare Part D patients covered at the lowest co-pay for a branded product.
Invokana/Invokamet sales were up nearly 18% on a worldwide basis and nearly 12% in the US.
In the US, Invokana/Invokamet TRx within the defined market of type II diabetes, excluding insulin and metformin, was 6.1%, up from 5.1% in the first quarter of 2015.
TRx with endocrinologists was 11.5% and 5.5% in the primary care.
On a sequential basis sales declined due to the extra shipping days in the fourth quarter, incremental rebates and savings program redemptions, as well as increased competition in formulary positions.
Invokana access remains strong at 80% preferred for combined commercial and Part D.
I'll now review the medical devices segment results.
Worldwide medical devices segment sales of $6.1 billion increased 0.5%.
US sales increased 2.2% while sales outside the US declined 1%.
Cordis was divested in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational sales growth was 3% worldwide, with the US up 3.3% and a growth of 2.8% outside the US.
Growth was driven by orthopedics, advanced surgery and electrophysiology.
Orthopedic sales growth was driven by worldwide knees and hips and US trauma and spine.
Market growth and the success of product launches drove results for the US orthopedics business.
Pricing pressure continued across the major categories, partially offset by positive mix for trauma and spine products.
The success of the TFNA nailing system in trauma, the ATTUNE platform in knees, our primary stem platform in hips and Orthovisc/Monovisc and new spine product introductions made important contributions to results.
Orthopedic sales outside the US were negatively impacted by results in China due to a softer demand and a reduction in inventory.
Trauma and spine, other where the categories most impacted.
In addition, timing of [tender] business negatively impacted trauma growth for the quarter.
Strong results were achieved for advance surgery products with endocutters growth of 10%, biosurgicals growth of 8% and energy growth of 8%.
Electrophysiology grew 19% worldwide due to strong market growth, complemented by new product launches and increased penetration for both ultrasound and diagnostic catheters.
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter of 2016.
Is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso.
Dominic?
Thanks, Louise, and good morning, everyone.
We carried last year's momentum into 2016 and we're off to a strong start this year.
We are very pleased with the results generated in the first quarter and we continue to make very good progress on our near-term priorities, as well as our long-term growth drivers which we discussed during our January call.
We remain confident in the strength of our business.
As we've previously discussed in 2015, our underlying operational sales growth which excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, as well as hepatitis C sales and a few extra shipping days in 2015, was 5.5%.
On this same basis, we gained momentum in the first quarter with strong underlying operational sales growth of approximately 7% and in line with analyst estimates.
In our pharmaceutical business our strong performance from 2015 continued into the first quarter, with underlying operational growth at over 12%.
First-quarter underlying operational sales growth for consumer increased approximately 4% when also adjusting for the impact of the devaluation in Venezuela that Louise mentioned earlier.
And in medical devices we're off to a good start in the first quarter, with underlying operational growth of approximately 3%.
Growth in our consumer-facing medical device businesses was negatively impacted by challenges in the diabetes market.
For the hospital-focused medical device businesses, we're seeing signs of continued improvement with underlying operational growth in those businesses of approximately 4%, driven by strength in our orthopedics, advanced surgery and electrophysiology businesses.
We also saw an improvement in our overall adjusted pretax operating margin.
For 2016, our guidance from January included a 200 basis point increase on an adjusted basis and we remain comfortable with that forecast, as we will accelerate throughout the year with the restructuring activities in our medical device business and lower levels of spending in the back half as compared to the prior year.
As a reminder, pretax operating margin is defined as gross profit less selling, marketing, administrative and R&D expenses.
Now I'll take a few minutes to highlight some key developments from the first quarter as well as some key points regarding our results.
And then I'll provide some updates to our guidance for you to consider in refining your models for 2016.
During the quarter we had several key developments across the business.
In our pharmaceutical business we received an additional approval for Imbruvica for first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
And also entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Tesaro for exclusive rights to the investigational compound niraparib in prostate cancer.
Niraparib is an orally administered poly polymerase, or PARP, inhibitor.
We also continued our efforts to combat major global health challenges through collaborations with government organizations and others in the industry, with a call for innovative ideas to reduce HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as providing funding for nonprofit organizations supporting under-served communities in the United States.
In March 2016 we entered into an agreement to sell our controlled substance raw material and API business.
In 2015 these businesses totaled approximately $250 million in net trade sales.
This divestiture remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals but is expected to be completed towards the middle of 2016.
In medical devices, Ethicon completed the acquisition of NeuWave Medical, a privately-held medical device company that manufactures and markets minimally invasive soft tissue microwave ablation systems.
We look forward to providing an in-depth review of the ongoing efforts of our consumer and medical device businesses at our upcoming business review meeting on May 18 which will take place in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
I will now turn to our consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter of 2016.
As we've mentioned, our operational sales growth this quarter was 3.9% and excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and Hep C sales, it was a strong 6.9%.
If you will direct your attention to the box section of the schedule, you will see we have provided our earnings adjusted to exclude intangible amortization and special items.
As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2016 first-quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude intangible asset amortization expense and special items of approximately $400 million on an after-tax basis which consisted primarily of the following: intangible asset amortization of $200 million and litigation charges and our medical devices restructuring charge.
Our adjusted earnings per share is therefore $1.68 per share, exceeding the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call.
This is an increase in adjusted EPS of 7.7% versus the prior year.
Adjusted EPS on a constant-currency basis was $1.72, up 10% over the prior year.
Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items in the statement of earnings.
Cost of goods sold increased by 10 basis points, mostly due to transactional currency, partially offset by a favorable mix in the business.
Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 26.8% of sales or 110 basis points lower as compared to the first quarter of 2015, due to continued good cost management.
Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was 11.5% higher than the prior year, due to increased project spending as we advance our promising product pipelines.
Our pretax operating margin, when excluding special items and intangible amortization expense, was 32.9%, 30 basis points higher than the first quarter of the prior year.
Interest expense net of interest income was lower than last year, due to slightly better rates on our investments.
Other income and expense was a net gain of $39 million in the quarter compared to a net gain of $348 million in the same period last year.
Excluding special items that are reflected in this line item, other income and expense was a net gain of $127 million compared to a net gain of $91 million in the prior-year period.
Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 19.2% compared to 21.5% in the same period last year.
This year's effective rate reflects the R&D tax credit which was passed by Congress late last year and the current mix of our business.
Turning to the next slide, I will now review adjusted income before tax by segment.
On our 2015 year-end call we commented on our segment results for adjusted income before tax versus the prior year.
Now that all of our competitors have reported their results for 2015, I would like to take the opportunity to point out that our 2015 adjusted income before tax was 31.4% compared to 26.2% weighted average for our competitive set.
This was driven by higher margins in both pharmaceutical and medical devices and somewhat lower margins in our consumer business as compared to our competitive set.
In the first quarter 2016 our adjusted income before tax for the enterprise improved 80 basis points versus the first quarter of 2015, driven by improvement in both our pharmaceutical and medical device businesses.
Our consumer business had a lower margin this year as compared to last year due principally to the devaluation in Venezuela.
We are confident that our consumer business will show an improved adjusted income before-tax margin for full-year 2016 as compared to 2015.
Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2016.
At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $17 billion of net cash which consists of approximately $40 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $23 billion of debt.
As you know, in February we took the opportunity to finance our share repurchase program and upcoming debt maturities at very attractive interest rates, with a debt issuance of $7.5 billion.
Through the end of the first quarter we completed approximately 25% of our $10 billion share repurchase program and we expect to complete 75% of the program by the end of this year.
For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of between $450 million and $550 million.
This is unchanged from our prior guidance.
Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development Corporation, divestitures, asset sales and write-offs.
We would be comfortable with your models for 2016 reflecting net other income and expense, excluding special items, as a net gain ranging from approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion.
And this is also unchanged versus our January guidance.
And now a word on taxes.
Our guidance for 2016 includes the R&D tax credit that Congress made permanent in 2015.
We are therefore comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2016, excluding special items, of approximately 19% to 20%, lower by 50 basis points than our previous guidance due to updating our outlook for a higher mix of our earnings from lower tax jurisdictions in 2016 than we anticipated in our previous guidance.
Now turning to sales and earnings.
Our sales and earnings guidance for 2016 takes into account several assumptions and key factors that I would like to highlight.
As a reminder, our sales guidance for 2016 assumes no biosimilar entrant for Procrit or Remicade in the US.
And our assumption with regard to Remicade biosimilar remains unchanged, even with the recent FDA approval of Inflectra, due to our intellectual property which we intend to defend.
We also do not anticipate generic competition this year from Zytiga, Risperdal Consta and Invega Sustenna.
But as expected, there are generic entrants for Invega and Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo.
As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant-currency basis, reflecting our results from operations.
This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a very good understanding of the underlying performance of our business.
We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2016 with the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.
Consistent with our previous guidance, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant-currency basis of between 2.5% and 3.5% for the year.
This would result in sales for 2016 on a constant-currency basis of approximately $71.9 billion to $72.6 billion.
Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our sales results in 2015, our operational sales growth for 2016, excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures and hepatitis C sales, would be approximately 5.5%, a level of growth comparable to last year, after adjusting for the extra shipping days in 2015 which we mentioned earlier.
The devaluation in Venezuela that we previously discussed is anticipated to be a headwind of approximately 30 basis points for the full year which we anticipate will be offset by the strength of the business.
Although we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, using the euro as of last week at $1.13, the negative impact of foreign currency translation would be approximately 1%.
This is an improvement of 50 basis points since we last provided guidance.
We are watching the euro and other currencies closely, as it is uncertain how they will eventually settle out for the year.
Plus, under this scenario we would expect reported sales to reflect the change in the range of 1.5 % to 2.5% for a total expected level of reported sales of approximately $71.2 billion to $71.9 billion higher than our previous guidance.
Now turning to earnings.
As a reminder, we expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross margin by approximately 60 to 80 basis points in 2016 as compared to 2015.
We would be comfortable with adjusted EPS guidance in a range between $6.56 to $6.71 per share on a constant-currency basis, reflecting an operational or constant-currency growth rate of 6% to 8%.
This is higher than our previous guidance.
If currency exchange rates for all of 2016 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported adjusted EPS would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 per share due to currency movements, a better outlook than the approximate $0.10 negative impact we discussed in our January guidance.
Therefore, we would be comfortable with our reported adjusted EPS ranging from $6.53 to $6.68 per share which is an increase from our previous guidance, due to an update to our tax rate and current currency estimates.
As it's still early in the year, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range.
In closing, we are very pleased with our strong start for the year and we are optimistic with what we see ahead for the full year.
Namely, we're expecting operational sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5% and underlying operational sales growth of 5.5%, consistent with 2015 growth on a comparable basis.
Our operating margin improvements are on track to meet the expectations we laid out in our guidance of more than 200 basis point improvement over the prior year.
Our operational adjusted EPS growth in our guidance remains strong, in the range of 6% to 8%.
And our businesses are continuing to invest while also delivering on our growth expectations.
In particular, we're pleased to see our medical device businesses showing continued signs of improvement and our restructuring activities in that business are on track.
We look forward to discussing with you in more detail these activities on our May 18 Investor Day.
Now I'd like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the call.
Louise?
Thank you, Dominic.
And, Manny, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?
(Operator Instructions)
David Lewis, Morgan Stanley.
I'm going to start with a strategic question for Dominic then one follow-up.
Dominic, the long-standing view of JNJ has been to assert the defensiveness of having these three major franchises under the JNJ family of companies.
Does that still remain the prevailing view of management and the Board?
And then I had a quick follow-up.
Yes, David.
It's our view, both management and the Board, that our broadly-based business is the right approach to have in healthcare.
It certainly has served us well and we expect it will continue to serve us well as healthcare industry evolves in the future.
We think of ourselves as a healthcare company and of course that allows us to access opportunities in healthcare no matter where they be, either in pharma, medical devices, or in consumer health.
Okay, that's very helpful.
And then the second question, maybe for Louise or Dominic, Remicade gross net dynamics in the quarter.
Any more detail you can provide us on that?
Or any sense of what you're expecting net pricing gains to be for Remicade in the US for 2016?
Thanks so much.
As we discussed, we had the prior-year gross to net that you saw that contributed, I think it was 3%, to the Remicade growth.
And pricing dynamics continued to be okay in that market.
I don't think it's expected that Remicade sales will be significantly impacted year over year by gross-to-net adjustments.
Okay, next question please.
Thank you very much.
Josh Jennings, Cowen and Company.
Thanks for taking the questions.
I know you've had some public comments, Dominic, recently around the Remicade franchise.
But now that we have the outcome panel and the FDA approval in the rear-view window, clearly you don't expect any biosimilar competition in 2016 due to the events of IP.
But any updated thoughts on the potential impacts of biosimilar competition to the Remicade franchise in 2017 and beyond?
You're right, Josh, we don't expect biosimilar competition in 2016.
As you know, we have several patents that we intend to defend.
For example, the US patent, the 471 patent, extends to 2018 and another patent that we have extends to 2027.
Having said that, I think overall the immunology franchise of Johnson & Johnson is very strong because it's not just about Remicade.
Of course we Stelara, Simponi, et cetera.
And the overall pipeline in the pharmaceutical business, as you know from our review last May is very, very robust, with 10 new products being filed, each of which having more than $1 billion potential.
So overall we've remained very, very comfortable with the growth outlook for the pharmaceutical business, regardless of the outcome of any Remicade biosimilar.
Thanks for that.
And I just wanted to follow up with a question on your operating margin guidance.
Maintaining that 200 basis, I was curious about the Venezuelan crisis impact.
It looks like it was primarily hit the consumer unit in the operating margins.
Can you talk about the expectations of Venezuela's impact on your operating margin at the beginning of the year, how your internal expectations have evolved?
Clearly with maintaining that guidance  the performance of the rest of the business units are going to offset any direct impact from Venezuela but I just wanted to hear about any offsets there and that impact to the operating margin from the consumer unit.
And can the consumer still experience operating margin expansion in 2016?
Thanks for taking the questions.
Yes sure, Josh.
Just to put things in perspective, Venezuela is less than 1% of our sales, less than 0.5% of our sales, so it's not a very significant impact.
It is more significant in consumer than in the other businesses but we're very confident in our outlook for a 200 basis point improvement in operating margin expansion -- pretax operating margin expansion for 2016.
That will be across all the businesses, including consumer who will make a significant contribution to that, even despite the impacts of Venezuela.
So we're very confident with that outlook for the year.
Thank you, next question please.
Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan.
The immunology franchise, Remicade, Simponi, Stelara, all had much better growth than the scripts would have suggested.
Outside of the gross to net, was there an inventory catch-up this quarter that might have impacted those products?
In the US nothing significant in the inventory.
That market grows strong, strong double-digits and is a good contributor to the immunology.
Stelara continues to grow market share; Simponi Aria is contributing to the results.
But in the US, no significant inventory builds.
Okay.
Can we talk about Darzalex?
Darzalex obviously, had a very, very strong first full quarter out of the box here.
Can you talk about the uptake in multiple myeloma and how you see it playing out on the back of the relapsed refractory data?
Yes, Mike, we're obviously very pleased with the early uptake of Darzalex.
As we said, it contributed 2 points of growth to our US pharma business, so off to a great start.
The CD38 mechanism of action seems to be something that the  KOLs really respect as having a significant impact on the disease.
We think the product is going to do extremely well and we will see continued uptake throughout the year.
And also we had the CASTOR trial which they actually -- the IDMC has recommended to stop early.
So that's a very positive sign as well in that end.
Dominic, one quick finance question for you.
The tax rate coming down is -- it runs a little bit of counter to the performance of the business because your growth in the US has been so strong, particularly in the pharmaceutical business.
So what we see optically is very strong US revenue growth and we assume US profit growth.
But obviously, the manufacturing IP of some of those products is outside the US.
Can you shed a little bit of light there on how you are managing that?
Because the US business relative to O-US business looks very different.
Yes, Mike, it's an excellent observation.
Actually the strength of the sales in any one particular region does not necessarily correlate with the strength of the earnings in that region.
It's for the very reason that you mentioned which is where the IP is located, where the manufacturing takes place, et cetera.
So what we did is we just updated our outlook with how the profits will fall amongst the different regions and different jurisdictions.
And we thought about 0.5 point improvement in the overall tax rate would be achievable this year for the full year.
Therefore, we adjusted that in our outlook.
Understood.
Thank you, Dominic.
Next question please.
Kristen Stewart, Deutsche Bank.
I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more about the diabetes business.
I think, Dominic, you had mentioned there's challenges in the market.
I was wondering if you could comment about Invokana and the additional competition that's in the market or provide a little bit more commentary there.
Sure.
Just to clarify what I said, I was talking about challenges in the market with respect to our consumer medical device diabetes business, the LifeScan business.
And what I meant by that was we see continued pricing pressure in that market and we also see some competition with respect to new pumps being launched.
We've just launched a new pump, obviously, so we're also seeing good uptake with our current pump.
So the dynamics I'm talking about are in the medical device piece of the business as being challenging.
Overall, Invokana continues to do well.
It's uptake is strong quarter over quarter, and remains a growth driver for us going forward.
Okay.
And then more broadly, what are you seeing?
Can you go back and address China?
I know that was something that you had brought up in terms of still seeing a little bit of softness.
I think you had mentioned more within the medical device segment.
Any changes there?
Is it getting worse or getting any better?
Sure.
China, again just to put it in perspective, it's about 5% overall business.
And a slowdown in the economy, actually last year, is what caused some distributor inventory to be at relatively high levels.
That distributor inventory is beginning to bleed off; we saw that in the first quarter.
And we think that bleed-off will be completed shortly so we don't expect to see a continued impact of that for the rest of the year.
Okay, perfect.
Thanks, everyone.
Next question please.
Jami Rubin, Goldman Sachs.
Good morning.
I have a few questions.
Back to Kristen's question on diabetes.
Invokana is an important growth driver for the Company but sales did come in a bit lighter than we had anticipated despite, I think, the growing excitement about this class of drugs.
Dominic, can you comment generally on what drug categories you are seeing widening gross-to-net discounts?
And are you seeing more gross-to-net discounts, or widening discounts, specifically in diabetes?
And can you comment on where you might be seeing that elsewhere in the pharma business?
My second question is on the OTC business.
You've clearly highlighted the strong growth that you're seeing in the US and particularly the analgesics market.
How much of that growth is just regaining back lost market share from private label when you were out of market?
And how much of that is market growth?
And maybe you can comment generally on the dynamics of the OTC marketplace and where you see store brand market share now.
Thanks.
And I have one more follow-up.
Wow. (laughter)
Okay, let's take them in order.
And, Louise, you could add, obviously, if I've left anything out.
I wouldn't say, Jami, that there's any one particular area in the business where we see the widening of gross to net or rebating that's any different than what we've seen before in the business.
So rather than comment on any one particular area, I would say generally speaking, there's nothing that sticks out to us as a widening trend.
With respect to US OTC, a couple things to mention.
We are gaining back share and the products are doing very, very well.
This particular quarter was a relatively low-growth market quarter because of a very, very soft flu season.
Very, very soft flu season.
So most of the growth that we saw is not on the back of market expansion but on the back of share expansion as we continue to regain share.
Are you where you want to be in terms of regaining back that lost share?
What is a realistic goal? (multiple speakers) market completely, where are you now?
We're not where we want to be.
We're pleased.
As Alex often says, we're please but not satisfied.
We're going to continue to gain share there.
And Louise, do you have the year-over-year comparison of share?
Yes.
In 2009, before the McNeil issues that we had, the adult share was about 25% and we're back to 14%.
The pediatric was about 70% and we're now back to 46%, so you're seeing some nice growth on that.
If you take a look at year over year, the adult share a year ago was 43%, so you see it going up about 3 points.
Then the pediatric share is also going up to the 46%.
I'm sorry, that was pediatric share, sorry, from 43% to 46%.
We're making progress, Jami, but we're not finished.
I think these products have a long heritage and legacy.
They're very, very important in overall healthcare.
Quite frankly, they're admired by consumers, so we expect to see continued share growth.
And in the adults it's 14% US share now and it was 12%.
And you asked about the private label.
We think in the US market the adult's about a third and in the pediatric it's about 40%.
Okay.
And then can I follow up, Dominic?
I'm actually shocked that I'm -- what -- the fifth, sixth question; this hasn't come up yet.
Your net cash position is now $17 billion; that keeps growing.
I don't think any company that I cover or anybody else covers has the kind of balance sheet prowess that you have, the lack of debt on your balance sheet.
And I think it was, back in September at a investor conference, you had mentioned that you were uncomfortable with the amount of cash that you had growing on the balance sheet.
And now here we are six to seven months later and don't really see any activity with respect to putting that cash to work, with the exception of a buyback that you announced earlier this year.
Can you give us an update on your thoughts on capital allocation?
Clearly, we've had a lot of disruption in the marketplace with valuations on many names coming back.
I'm just surprised that we haven't really seen much action on the part of capital allocation from JNJ.
Thanks.
And then I'm done.
Okay, good. (laughter) Just to clarify, back in September, I didn't really say I was uncomfortable with the level of cash.
I just said that it was a higher level of cash that we normally hold.
And then of course after that, we announced a $10 billion share buyback.
So we're very conscious of the fact that while we're evaluating M&A opportunities, we can continue to return capital to shareholders which in addition to our very, very strong dividend, we can do share buybacks.
We're in the middle of doing one right now.
We'll obviously evaluate whether we continue to increase that particular share buyback as time goes on.
With respect to not allocating capital to any particular deals, I can tell you that we're very active.
But as you know, we're also very disciplined.
We do see opportunities but we want to do the right deal, at the right time, with the right party, at the right valuation.
And we're comfortable waiting for that to take place because we think that's what ultimately generates the most value for shareholders.
But is that what you plan to do with your cash, M&A, Dominic?
Is that what the message is today?
The message is very consistent what it's always been.
Our first priority is allocating capital to dividends.
So we'll announce what were going to do with dividends at our April 28 shareholder meeting.
After that we'd like to grow the business and create value for shareholders through M&A.
In addition to that, we will continue to return capital to shareholders through share repurchase.
So it's not really a change.
Our attitude, our capital allocation policy has not changed depending on how much capital we have.
It's all about creating the most value for shareholders with whatever capital we deploy.
Thank you.
Next question please.
Glenn Novarro, RBC Capital Markets.
Just two questions.
Let me first piggyback on what Jami just asked.
Because I think we're all surprised that JNJ hasn't done more with the balance sheet so far.
And I'm wondering, Dominic, as you're having these discussions, it appears that some of the targets you may be having discussions with have unrealistic valuation expectation.
So talk about where valuation expectations have come.
Are they getting at least in the ballpark of what JNJ thinks is appropriate valuation?
And then with Allergan and Pfizer no longer getting together, you have two more companies that are going to be actively looking at deals.
Does that make the competitive landscape more challenging for JNJ?
And then I had a follow-up on devices.
Thank you.
Sure, Glenn.
In certain areas of the market valuations are still high.
They're coming down, as you know, in biotech in particular.
But in certain other areas, in med device for example, certain valuations are still inflated, in our opinion.
Things will get better as time goes on, we believe.
We're patient, disciplined, and as I said earlier, we'll look for the right opportunity but at the right time at the right valuation.
With respect to Allegan and Pfizer being in the market now and creating more competition, that's probably true.
I can't speak for what they're going to do but we're accustomed to looking at various acquisition candidates where more than one party may be interested in a particular asset.
That does not dissuade us from being disciplined and having a clear focus on ultimately what matters, which is the deployment of that capital to create shareholder value.
So yes, there'll be more competition; we'll still remain very disciplined.
Okay.
And then let me follow up on the device business.
When you [exited] out divestitures and currency, the device business grew 3% in the first quarter.
That's pretty much in line with most of the device categories that we cover.
But I don't think JNJ had any major new product launches here recently.
So is the improvement in the device business for JNJ, is that just better execution and better blocking and tackling?
Or did some of the major end markets in cardio and ortho and spine in the first quarter come in slightly better than you expected?
Thank you.
Yes, just to clarify, 3% overall is the medical device business, ex-acquisition, divestitures.
But the hospital-based medical device business, excluding the consumer-facing medical device businesses, that grew 4% on a comparable basis.
We did have a number of products that we filed last year and we have about 30 new products that we're launching.
Half of those have already been launched so we are seeing the impact of those.
I think it's also a matter of focus -- focus on the primary growth drivers.
For example, you saw very good results in energy and endocutters, in electrophysiology as major drivers of growth.
And also we're very pleased with the results in orthopedics and the ATTUNE knee.
For example, in the US in particular, the US growth was over 8% for knees which is pretty fantastic growth.
And the ATTUNE knee is still a new product that's being launched in that marketplace.
As you talk to division heads, is everything -- are the end markets status quo, no change, still stable?
Or is there any pick-up in some of these end markets?
I think from what we've seen back in the fourth-quarter trends, because we don't have all the first-quarter trends, continued improvement in procedural growth.
But not dramatic, Glenn, just a continued steady improvement in procedural growth.
Anything else, Louise?
Yes.
Our estimate of the first-quarter hip market is about 3.5% in the US.
Again, qualified, but we haven't seen all the competitor's report.
We think the US knee market grew about 4.5% and we believe we grew faster than those markets.
Now we did have about 1.5 extra selling days, but even if you take that out of there, we do believe we grew faster than the market in hips and knees in the US.
Okay.
Thanks Louise.
Thank you, Dominic.
Next question please.
Vamil Divan, Credit Suisse.
Thanks so much for taking the question.
Just a couple following up on some of the topics that have been raised already.
The one we've  been getting a lot of questions around are on the consumer side.
Can you maybe do business development and I know you talk generally about M&A.
If you could provide a little more color on the consumer side specifically.
And in Venezuela where you're looking at [bouy stusit].
Is there a preference you can share?
I think in the past you've talked about emerging markets.
I was wondering if there's anything more time you can share today on that side of things.
The second question relates back to the Invokana discussion that was going on before.
There was this announcement last week that the EMA is now looking into an increase in amputations that is being seen in the CANVAS study.
I'm curious if you have any comments on that at this point.
And also is there something that the FDA is also looking into at this point?
Thanks.
Sure, Vamil.
On M&A in general, we're looking at M&A as an important additional growth driver in all of our businesses, including consumer.
As we've said before, consumer can generally benefit from taking very, very specific brands that are in certain regional categories.
We're certainly in our sweet spot of skin care, baby, oral care, et cetera, where we think we could do better with a combination of the technology that we have in the overall market and distribution presence that we have.
So we'll continue to look there.
And again, like every other M&A evaluation, we'll make sure that it's at the right valuation at the right time.
With respect to Invokana, a couple things to mention there.
There's been -- previous to this CANVAS study -- there's been 12 previous studies with Invokana where we saw no such indication of increase in lower limb amputations, particularly the toe.
So this seems to be focused only on the patients in the CANVAS study.
It's important to note that, yes, the European regulatory body is taking a look at it.
But already the independent monitoring committee that reviews the clinical trial, after reviewing all the data, concluded that the trial should continue.
So that's what I can tell you about that.
Obviously we'll look to advise physicians appropriately of the results once we have more understanding of them.
Thank you, next question please.
Geoff Meacham, Barclays.
Just a couple on the pharma segment.
You guys have a new product cycle obviously coming up with guselkumab and sirukumab.
When you think about this in the context of the pricing environment, especially with Inflectra down the road, how do you guys think about durability of pricing in the immunology segment?
And I have one more follow-up on pharma.
Sure.
Both guselkumab and sirukumab are different mechanisms of action than the current products that we have in immunology.
Typically, innovative products that have a significant impact on unmet medical need, in this case it would be those pieces that are not otherwise responding to, for example, TNF therapy, our view is that pricing will still continue to be -- the products will still continue to be valued and therefore not have a lot of pressure on pricing.
Because there is still some significant unmet medical needs and it's a new mechanism of action that should have an impact on patients.
I think that's irrespective of whether or not there's a biosimilar in the market with respect to Remicade.
Overall, pricing or immunology products, particularly in the TNF category, already have pretty significant gross-to-net discounts in the marketplace.
I think we've talked before about that ours are already in the 25% range.
I don't think there's that much room for there to be significantly lower pricing in that market.
Got you.
And then as a follow-up to other questions on the M&A.
The Tesaro agreement with PARP clearly is a lot of excitement with this class.
The question is, was the focus on prostate strategic or is it data-driven?
I want to get your sense, Dominic, for other indications that you could have some enthusiasm for, for PARP such as ovarian or breast cancer, et cetera.
Our agreement with respect to this PARP inhibitor was a result of our oncology therapeutic area taking a look at where PARPs can have an added benefit.
Our first approach to this is going to be with prostate cancer in conjunction with our development of ARN-509 in prostate cancer.
So the particular focus at the moment is in prostate cancer, Geoff.
Got you.
Next question please.
Damien Conover, Morningstar.
Just a question on the nerve growth factor discontinuation.
It looked like there was a prioritization within the pipeline to discontinue that.
I had a question what projects you might be accelerating.
Also given that those Phase 3 studies were coming up shortly, I wanted to understand that a little bit more.
Also with hepatitis C products there, you have some very potent products.
I wanted to see what the next steps were for bringing those to the market, the timeline.
And then lastly, on Remicade, has JNJ received a 180-day notice of a biosimilar launch from Pfizer?
Thank you.
All right, let me take them in the order you gave them and Louise can help here as well.
With respect to -- why don't you take the hepatitis C question?
Okay, so we're expecting to see some Phase 2 data of the AL-335 and the three direct-acting inhibitors in 2016.
Right.
And also with respect to your question on the 180-day notice period, yes, we have received that from Celltrion.
And with respect to the growth nerve factor discontinuants, what you said was exactly right, this is a portfolio question.
As we've mentioned, we have 10 new products that we're planning to file between now and 2019.
Obviously we're going to focus on those; they all have more than $1 billion potential.
We make portfolio decisions all the time and this is just another one of those types of decisions.
Great, thank you.
Next question please.
Matt Miksic, UBS.
This is Vic in for Matt.
I have two questions.
None of the CJR bundle payment system is in effect for hips and knees.
Can you talk a little bit about your approach to customers and what you can expect to help there?
And the second question I have is an update on the payer environment in spine.
Any meaningful changes that you guys have seen in support amongst payers?
Thank you.
Generally speaking on the bundling approach, which is now present in certain markets but not across all markets in the US, we do think that we're positioned very well there.
Obviously, we have a very broad portfolio of products so the bundling approach with the hospital or integrated care network would include multiple Johnson & Johnson products, which we think we're in a great position to partner with in that regard.
The payer economics in spine, we haven't seen much of a dramatic change there.
One thing I'd like to point out is we did see growth in our spine business this quarter of about 2%, so we're very pleased with that business coming back and showing some improvement.
We'll take one more question.
Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.
Good morning, thanks for fitting me in.
I hope you can hear me okay.
So, Dominic, on the call today you got into organic sales growth in 2016 of about the same as in 2015 which was 5.5%, excluding the benefit from extra selling days.
However, if we compare 2016 to 2015 organic growth on the same 52-week basis, we estimate that your 2016 organic growth should be closer to 6% to 6.5%.
In other words, the 5.5% in 2016 doesn't adjust for the extra selling days in 2015.
Is our math directionally right, Dominic?
And I had one follow-up.
Yes, I think you're directionally right.
I think you're right that without the -- if you just neutralized, I guess is what you did -- the extra selling days, you would see growth of better than 5.5%.
Right, yes.
Okay, I just wanted to confirm that.
And then lastly, Dominic, last week you announced that you discontinued UPP, or unilateral pricing policy, in your Vistakon business.
Can you talk about the rationale there and what this signals regarding any change in your strategy and how your running your contact lens business?
If I recall two years ago when you implemented UPP, it was disruptive to your US Vistakon business.
Why should we not assume or be concerned that you might have similar types of disruptions from discontinuing UPP and moving to a different pricing model now?
Thanks for taking the questions.
Sure, Larry, thanks for the question.
Just a couple things on the vision care business and our Acuvue brand.
As you know, the Acuvue business has a long heritage of strong category growth as well as good innovation which creates a fantastic products for contact lens wearers.
And as you know, we are the world leader in contact lenses with the Acuvue brand.
We just launched four new products in 2015 which are being received very well by the eye care professional and the contact lens wearer.
Back in 2014 we did not have that kind of innovation coming to market, first of all.
And secondly, we saw some unevenness in the pricing in the market with very, very different pricing and different channels.
So we decided to implement the unilateral pricing policy in order to even out the pricing.
At the end of the day what happened there was, we did see a lower overall price for our products which made the products more affordable.
So today the majority of the patients who get Acuvue contact lenses are paying less than they did for that brand two years ago.
Now with innovation, with the market stabilizing, we've adopted a new program that encourages patients to see their eye care professional and provides rebates and incentives for the purchase of contact lenses in conjunction with their eye exam as prescribed by the eye care professional.
We think that's just the next evolution as a market leader to focus on eye health and not just price of the contact lens.
So just a continued evolution of how we approach the market  and when there is some slight disruption in the market, we think that overall the long-term benefit to the overall category and to our business is worth it.
Thank you and that concludes the Q&A and we will have some closing remarks from Dominic.
Okay, thanks, Louise.
As I noted earlier, we're very pleased with our continued momentum as we entered into 2016.
I would just like to take this time to recognize and thank all of our associates around the world for their extraordinary achievements and dedication to the success of Johnson & Johnson.
Thank you for your time this morning.
I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year and have a great day.
Thank you.
